      "Nairobi, Kenya, November, 30th 2017: Sweden International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) and Africa Enterprise Challenge Fund (AECF) have signed a five year agreement worth 400 million SEK (US $48 million) to fund the Renewable Energy, Adaptation and Climate Change Technology sub-Saharan Africa (REACT SSA) window.  \n",
      "“During my travels in rural Kenya I have seen how important it is for households, especially for women and girls, to get access to basic electricity. These systems are often based on solar cells that decrease indoor air pollution and lower the cost for poor households as it substitutes kerosene,” said the Swedish Ambassador, Anna Jardfelt Melvin, on signing the five-year agreement.\n",
      "The REACT SSA competition targets small and medium-sized companies (SMEs) in Ethiopia, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Liberia, Burkina Faso and Mali to stimulate SMEs, to develop business models, efficient services and products in the renewable energy sector that improve the lives of the rural poor.\n",
      "“We look forward to working with our development partners as we take this initiative forward. The generosity of the Swedish people and the scale of Sida’s commitment to a Pan-African approach towards meeting the SDGs is an example of best practice that should be widely emulated,” said AECF Board Chairman, Lord Paul Boateng. “This represents an endorsement of the new AECF and its approach to the key role the private sector plays in promoting rural jobs and reduction of poverty across Africa.”\n",
      "Over the past six years, the REACT window has demonstrated the potential of renewable energy technologies and businesses to reach Africa’s rural communities.\n",
      "“We hope that the new business models developed in East Africa, providing electricity to millions of people off the national grid, will rapidly be taken up in Liberia and generally in West Africa, promoting learning across the continent,” says SIDA Head of Development Cooperation – Liberia, Elisabeth Hårleman.\n",
      "REACT SSA is open to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), to develop business models, services and products in renewable energy and energy efficiency that improve the lives of the rural poor.  The companies will be selected through competitions that will be run from June 2018.\n",
      "“REACT SSA will  leverage  atleast an additional 360 million SEK from the private sector as matching funds to the 400 million SEK granted by Sida,” added Dr. Paul Greener, CEO, the AECF.\n",
      "About 60% of the population in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) do not have access to electricity and are forced to rely on kerosene, fire wood or batteries - solutions that are expensive, unreliable and environmentally unsustainable. While the demand for energy in rural areas is increasing, the provision of electricity is skewed greatly towards higher-income households and urban areas, leaving out a large proportion of the target population.\n",
      "Increased access to clean energy reduces the binding constraint to growth that a lack of power represents in rural areas. Providing low cost, clean energy will improve the lives of the poor as their children will be able to read, write and study using cost-effective lighting, as well as reducing indoor air pollution caused by kerosene lamps.\n",
      "The support to the REACT SSA window is part of Sweden’s special efforts to promote renewable energy and energy efficiency in sub-Saharn Africa and its comittment  to mobilize one billion dollars over the next ten years, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n",
      "Editors Notes: About Sida\n",
      "Sweden International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) is a government agency working on behalf of the Swedish parliament and government, with the mission to reduce poverty in the world.

The Fund supports innovative commercial businesses in the agribusiness, renewable energy and adaptation to climate change technology sectors with the aim of reducing rural poverty, promoting resilient rural communities and creating jobs through private sector development. The AECF invests in businesses that are seen as “risky” and that struggle to meet traditional risk-return standards for commercial investors and which offer significant impact on poverty alleviation by creating jobs and sustainable incomes.\n",
      "Since 2008, the AECF has been supported by donor governments namely Australia, Canada, Denmark, Netherlands, Sweden, United Kingdom, and international finance institutions such as the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor and IFAD.\n",
      "In 2017, the AECF entered a new phase as a standalone institution within the AGRA family with the objective of expanding its geographical reach, double its funding base and increase its transformative impact on inclusive growth. To achieve this the Fund will deepen its focus on gender issues, youth and employment. The new strategy will build on the Fund’s track record of creating sustainable rural livelihoods through private sector-led initiatives that change the way markets work for the poor.\n",

      "Agriculture and agribusiness accounts for 32 percent of GDP in Sub-Saharan Africa and employs 65 percent of the work force. It is likely to have a bigger impact on poverty reduction than in other sectors as it offers the most direct route of raising returns to poor people’s main assets, i.e. land and labour. The AECF’s work in the agriculture sector is the oldest and largest of its investments with a total of US$ 183 million committed across Africa. The Fund supports businesses to establish a new activity or expand existing businesses across the value chain, as long as the primary beneficiaries of the businesses are rural households living on less than US$ 2 per day. \n",
      "Accessible Innovations for Smallholders: The Fund invests in businesses that have the potential to reach smallholder farmers to improve agricultural productivity and increase household income and food security. We work in a wide range of value chains and production systems to increase access to better quality agricultural inputs, improved seeds varieties and livestock vaccines, introduce new farming systems and agribusiness models. \n",
      "Scaling Up Innovative Businesses: The Fund acts as the missing link between agricultural research and smallholder farmers by financing the commercialization of new technologies where others will not. Key investment areas include new fertilizers, vaccines, integrated pest management, disease resistant crops and soil testing.\n",
      "Post Conflict and Fragile States: Post conflict and fragile states face particular challenges but the private sector is a key player in supporting the reconstruction of agribusinesses in these countries. With other sources of capital largely absent, the AECF provides critical funding which has been a key driver in the re-establishment of agricultural value chains in Zimbabwe, Mozambique, South Sudan, Somalia, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). \n",
      "Open data and media to increase productivity: The Fund supports low cost communication technologies and business models for information and data sharing that can reach a large audience and provide information to smallholder farmers enabling them to improve agricultural productivity and incomes.\n",
      "Promoting Financial Inclusion and Mobile Finance: Improving access to finance is a priority for AECF. The Fund supports projects that use mobile money systems, create local financing mechanisms, introduce weather based insurance and establish credit systems. This improves agricultural productivity and household incomes. It also establishes non-collateral credit scoring for smallholders that enable them to access formal financial systems in the future.\n",

      "Sitting on a rickety bench at his home in Kipipiri, in central Kenya, Samuel Macharia pulls a piece of paper from his pocket and proudly points to the signature at the bottom.\n",
      "The precious document is a farming contract Macharia signed in March with the East African Potato Consortium. It says he will sell at least two tonnes of potatoes to food processors each harvesting season for the next two years. “Thanks to this contract I can earn up to 22,000 Kenyan shillings ($213) per season,” he said.\n",
      "Recurring drought and sudden cold spells have affected the quality of potatoes and other staples across Kenya. Peris Mukami, a farmer from Timau village, in Meru County, said her potato yields had declined by over 10 percent in the past two years because “it is either too cold or too hot”. “The cold damages potato vines with frostbite while heat makes them wilt,” she explained.\n",
      "To try to fight back, Kenyan potato farmers such as Macharia are increasingly turning to production contracts with food processors – a system known as contract farming – through the East African Potato Consortium. By working with the consortium, they get access to seeds that better stand up to harsher conditions, as well as better fertilizers. They also get a guaranteed price for their crop, as long as they produce good-quality potatoes on time, said Wachira Kaguongo, head of the National Potato Council.\n",
      "The consortium, which was set up in 2016 by the National Potato Council, the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa and the Grow Africa partnership, aims to increase private investment in agriculture by linking potato farmers with food processors across the country, Kaguongo said.\n",
      "Each production agreement is reviewed and approved by the National Potato Council, which ensures it is fair to both parties, said Willy Bett, cabinet secretary of the Kenyan Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries.\n",
      "“Businessmen will always want to get farmers to sign something that may not be favorable to them,” Bett told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “We’re trying to prevent that by ensuring that farming activity is done on a contract basis in Kenya.”\n",
      "Contract farming has allowed farmers to sell produce to food giants such as the fast-food chain KFC, formerly known as Kentucky Fried Chicken.\n",

      "In Africa, when conditions are right, change can happen fast. Agriculture forms a significant portion of the economies of all African countries. As a sector it can contribute towards major continental priorities, such as eradicating poverty and hunger, boosting intra-Africa trade and investments, rapid industrialization and economic diversification, sustainable resource and environmental management, and creating jobs, human security and shared prosperity.\n",
      "When I travel across Africa today, I see the biggest gains in food production occurring in response to economic opportunity. That fills me with optimism, and not just because it has major implications for the fight against hunger. It’s important because Africans need agriculture to do much more than provide food security: they also need agriculture to provide a strong foundation for generating jobs and income, particularly for impoverished people.\n",

      "It is not every day that agriculture, especially smallholder agriculture in Africa, is the focus of attention in the Silicon Valley. The last week of November 2017, therefore, was like none other in many ways. Most notably, the end of year meeting of the AGRA Board was hosted at Stanford University by the Center on Food Security and the Environment and Stanford’s Board of Trustees Chair’, Jeff Raikes, who was completing the final meeting of his term on the AGRA Board.\n",
      "As part of the itinerary, the AGRA Board, chaired by one of Africa’s most astute businessmen, Mr. Strive Masiyiwa and comprised of such notable personalities like the former President of Tanzania, H.E. Jakaya Kikwete, met with a rich representation of the Silicon Valley leadership. At a dinner event, former President Kikwete gave a keynote statement on the status of Africa’s agricultural transformation. He particularly emphasized its centrality to the continent’s economic transformation. He also spoke to the sector’s huge potential and the opportunities for scale-up through technology and innovation, as Silicon Valley has done so well in all sectors.\n",
      "In a town hall-style discussion with students at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, Mr. Masiyiwa discussed the pathway to Africa’s transformation through entrepreneurship. He emphasized the need to go beyond philanthropy calling for the creation of opportunities for students to engage in the continental agenda through exchange of talent.\n",
      "The AGRA team also met with several members of the Google team to talk about the company’s innovative work in Africa. Discussions focused on cutting edge projects like the Next Billion Initiative that seeks to provide internet connectivity to the next billion users and the role such initiatives can play in Africa’s agricultural transformation.\n",
      "The week’s activities, once again, underscored the need for broad-based partnerships, including with the tech community, to fully get Africa on a path to an inclusive economic transformation powered by agriculture; its most important sector.\n",

      "Africa, now home to a population of more than 1.2 billion people, which is expected to double by 2050, faces a mounting challenge of feeding its people, growing its economy, creating decent jobs and improving the quality life for its citizens.\n",
      "Transforming agriculture, the sector that employs the majority of Africans and holds the greatest promise for economic prosperity will be critical in this pursuit.\n",
      "Yet, despite the expenditure of billions of dollars on agricultural development, the most of Africa’s farmers continue to harvest one metric tonne or of grain per hectare, consigning them to an impoverished, subsistence existence. Experience from the frontlines of agricultural development in Africa reveals that a major factor in this dilemma is the lack of access to quality seeds.\n",
      "The breeding and supply of seed of higher-yielding crop varieties has been the starting point of virtually every Green Revolution. Yet the critical challenge of seed scarcity among Africa’s farmers became evident in the early this century almost by accident. At that time, maize farmers in parts of East Africa were battling a serious infestation by a parasitic called Striga that was hitting their yields hard. This prompted research on different maize varieties resistant to the parasite. In the process of doing so, however, the researchers discovered even farmers who had no Striga on their farms were still getting very low yields. There must be a broader problem than Striga, they concluded.\n",
      "A broader set of analyses led to the conclusion that a lack of plant breeders and funding to support the creation of new varieties was at the heart of the challenge. Yet every African country had agricultural research stations where the work could be done, and no shortage of eager young agriculturalists ready to learn the science of plant breeding. Equally important, every country possessed its share of seed entrepreneurs and vendors eager to create businesses from the supply of new seeds.\n",
      "In 2006, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and The Rockefeller Foundation came together to establish the Programme for Africa’s Seed Systems within the Alliance for a GreenRevolution in Africa to address the challenges associated with supplying Africa’s farmers with higher-yielding, locally adapted seeds. A decade later, crop breeders working in public institutes in Africa have developed over 600 new crop varieties. Over 500 plant breeders have been trained at MSc and PhD levels through the programme. Africa’s emerging “agri-preneurs” have likewise stepped forward to work with breeders to fill the seed supply gap, bulking up seed of the new varieties on production plots in 18 countries and selling the seed through local shops known as agro-dealers. The new seed is in high demand. Approximately 110 recently formed seed companies are now producing over 130 metric tonnes of certified seeds every year, sufficient for about 15 million farmers.\n",
      "The invisible hand of improved seed is broadly lifting farmer productivity in Africa. Crop yields across the continent are shifting upward for the first time in decades. As we travel across the land, the evidence we are seeing is clear: Thousands of small-holder farmers have shown they can double and triple their harvests, provided they have access to the right seed, fertilizer, and expertise. The importance of establishing functional, responsive seed supply systems in every African country is now well past the proof-of-concept stage, and represents an imperative for Africa’s prosperity. More exciting, the goal of ending hunger in Africa now appears achievable in our lifetimes.\n",
      "Seeds alone, however, will not get the continent on a path to prosperity. Farmers will require access to credit facilities as well as links to national and regional markets to sell their surpluses. Forward-looking policies that promote the activities of private agri-businesses, and access to capital for their growth are needed to extend the revolution to the outer boundaries of African agriculture.\n",
      "We are immensely proud of the gains made in the African seed sector. In a new book, The PASS Journey: Seeding an African Seed Revolution, we have attempted to document the progress, challenges and next steps, as well as shine a light on a few unsung heroes — plant breeders, seed producers, university lecturers, shop keepers, and others — who work under tough conditions in remote locations to ensure Africa’s harvest continues to grow.\n",
      "The foundation has been laid. With all the right investments now, Africa can quickly join the ranks of the world’s regions who have overcome their ‘food hurdle’ on the route to greater prosperity and stability.\n"

      "Food security experts identify government support, policy implementation, private sector engagement and investment in smallholder farmers as keys to Africa’s agricultural future.\n",
      "Food security experts from the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA) gathered to discuss transforming food production in Africa at Stanford on Nov. 29. The symposium, hosted by the Center on Food Security and the Environment (FSE) examined the challenges, strategies, and possible solutions for catalyzing and sustaining an inclusive agriculture transformation in Africa.\n",
      "Moderator Ertharin Cousin, FSE visiting fellow and previous World Food Programme director with more than 25 years of experience on hunger, food, and resilience strategies, launched the panel by outlining Africa’s plight. “Today some 100 million of the farmers across Sub-Saharan Africa farm less than 2 hectares of land. Some 80 percent of those living in rural areas are poor. More than 30 percent of the rural population is chronically hungry and 35 percent of the under-five-year-olds are stunted. By 2050, the bulk of the world’s population growth will take place on the continent. In fact, some project that 1.3 billion will be added to the continent, and Nigeria’s [population] will grow larger than the size of the United States between now and 2050,” Cousin said\n",
      "While Africa continues to experience the highest occurrence of food insecurity worldwide, the continent also contains over 60 percent of the worlds uncultivated but fertile land. AGRA formed in 2006 to fulfill the vision that Africa can feed itself and the world. Panelists included Agnes Kalibata, AGRA President and former Minister of Agriculture and Animal Resources of Rwanda; Kanayo F. Nwanze, AGRA board member and immediate past president of the International Fund for Agricultural Development; Usha Barwale Zehr, AGRA board member and Director and Chief Technology Officer of Maharashtra Hybrid Seeds Company Private Limited; and Rajiv Shah, AGRA board member, Rockefeller Foundation President and former Administer of USAID.\n",
      "Kanayo F. Nwanze stressed the importance of agricultural transformation for Africa’s future. “No country in the world ever transformed itself without going through an agrarian change. No country. Europe, 17th; Japan, 18th century; 19th century was the US, your country; China, 20th century. Why should they be different from Africa? So, first and foremost, we have to have total agricultural transformation,” Nwanze said.\n",
      "AGRA president, Agnes Kalibata, also spoke to the need for policy implementation and government support in helping drive change. “AGRA as an institution can only do so much. But these governments have the potential and the capacity to reach every corner of their countries. The problem is they are challenged by capacity to do that, by capacity to design proper programs, and by capacity to implement these programs,” Kalibata said.\n",
      "Expanding on governments’ ability to impact and drive change, Usha Barwale Zehr highlighted Asia’s success, specifically with strategic partnerships. “…we’ve done a lot of talking about public/private partnership. Not so much on the ground on implementing it in a manner, which happened in Asia, for instance, where there was policy, and, most importantly, government will. The government was willing to do whatever it took to make sure that agriculture was transformed at the end of it,” Zehr said.\n",
      "Beyond government and policy support the panelists also addressed the need for innovation and access to seed technologies. “Why is it that the African farmer and the Indian farmer should not have access to what the American farmer has access to today and reaps benefit from it? …So it’s the hybrids, the varieties, the GM technology. Tomorrow it’ll be the gene-edited products. And after that we will talk about the satellite-based imaging data that we will use for developing drought-tolerant crops for that very, very small micro environment that existed in the one district in Nigeria,” Zehr said.\n",
      "“By 2050, who is going to feed Africa? … It’s the youth of today. But they’re not going to be using the same technologies that exist today. Just think of what IT can do, aggregation, organization of farmer’s groups. So, the elements are there. I see the agriculture of tomorrow meeting the challenge – for Africa meeting that challenge is Africa being at the forefront of feeding the world. Africa has to be able to feed itself first. And we have all the opportunities there,” Nwanze said.\n",
      "This is the first installment of the Global Food Security Symposium series hosted by Stanford University’s Center on Food Security and the Environment and generously supported by Zach Nelson and Elizabeth Horn.

      "The PDI team has deep respect for Africa’s farmers and is dedicated to serving their needs in professional, cost-effective ways.  Many of us are farmers, ourselves, who grew up in rural, farm settings.  We understand the value of better technologies in farmers’ lives, but we also understand the importance of market forces in encouraging or discouraging their uptake.  In order for investments in more productive farming methods to be sustained, farmers need to be compensated.  Hence, the PDI team works seamlessly with colleagues in the downstream fields of on-farm storage and marketing, to help create a truly sustainable, inclusive, agricultural transformation in Africa.\n",
      "The Program Development and Innovation (PDI) team at AGRA is responsible for developing and implementing initiatives that allow Africa’s smallholder farmers to increase the productivity of their farms.  The PDI team is composed of experts in the fields of crop breeding and seed systems, fertilizer supply systems, agricultural extension, input distribution, and capacity building, who work side-by-side with AGRA program officers in “Geographic Service Teams” across the region to help farmers increase their crop yields.\n",
      "The biggest hurdle to increasing farmer productivity in Africa today is the continued use of outdated production technologies and practices.  Nevertheless, broad experience has shown that Africa’s farmers – like farmers everywhere – will adopt new technologies when they are useful, affordable, and available locally.  Past investments by AGRA in plant breeding have yielded over 600 new crop varieties which are higher-yielding, resistant to local pests and diseases, and are more resilient in the face of environmental and climatic stress.  Meanwhile, AGRA’s collaborations with the African private sector have contributed to the establishment of over 100 private, independent seed companies and over 25,000 village-based agro-dealers.  Parallel initiatives in the development and marketing of new blends of fertilizer which are formulated to suit local soil types are now underway.\n",
      "Nevertheless, awareness of the value of this new technology at farmer level remains low, restricting both demand and supply.  Communicating to farmers the opportunity to improve their lives and livelihoods through the adoption of improved seed, fertilizer, and other inputs helps unleash demand at local levels.  Helping entrepreneurs and public officials to build systems that deliver high-quality inputs will allow input markets to grow to scale across the program area, at which point AGRA’s services will no longer be required.\n"

      "Determining whether you are eligible to apply for and receive AGRA funding is critical. If you are not eligible for a specific funding opportunity, you would waste time and money completing the application process when you cannot actually receive the grant. When considering eligibility, the first step is to know what type of organization you represent (refer to categories listed below). AGRA makes awards only to those organizations that have been determined to possess the operational capability, technical expertise, adequate internal controls and experience to implement AGRA transformative agenda. AGRA’s aim is to invest in projects that have measurable impact and can create meaningful, transformative change in the agriculture sector in Africa.\n",
      "AGRA undertakes demand driven Interventions that leverage donor, private sector, and government investments in agriculture. AGRA areas of intervention include Seed Supply, fertiliser value chains, farmer awareness, Markets, finance and Capacity building.\n",

This entails sensitizing current and potential applicants on the dates of the next call for proposals through various communication and sensitization channels such as advertisements in media, quarterly review meetings and project launches, especially in the geographical regions or grantee categories where the response to calls is found to be low.\n",
      "A Request for Proposals (RFP), Request for Applications (RFA) and Request for Concept Notes (RFCN) are the official announcement to the public of the solicitation for grants applications.  RFAs and RFCNs are usually posted on the AGRA website as well as on other suitable media.  All applications must be emailed or submitted online at rfcn@agra.org quoting the request (RFA/RFCN) reference. Consortia applications are submitted jointly by all partners.

We understand that African farmers need uniquely African solutions designed to meet their specific environmental and agricultural needs so they can sustainably boost production and gain access to rapidly growing agriculture markets.\n",
      "For nearly 10 years, AGRA’s work across 18 countries was focused on distinct problems related to seed production, soil health, and agriculture markets that were so profound and had been neglected for so long that they required a concentrated effort to resolve. Our results have been impressive. Now, we’re embarking on an ambitious and more integrated approach in select countries.\n",

      "The PDI team has deep respect for Africa’s farmers and is dedicated to serving their needs in professional, cost-effective ways.  Many of us are farmers, ourselves, who grew up in rural, farm settings.  We understand the value of better technologies in farmers’ lives, but we also understand the importance of market forces in encouraging or discouraging their uptake.  In order for investments in more productive farming methods to be sustained, farmers need to be compensated.  Hence, the PDI team works seamlessly with colleagues in the downstream fields of on-farm storage and marketing, to help create a truly sustainable, inclusive, agricultural transformation in Africa.\n",
      "The Program Development and Innovation (PDI) team at AGRA is responsible for developing and implementing initiatives that allow Africa’s smallholder farmers to increase the productivity of their farms.  The PDI team is composed of experts in the fields of crop breeding and seed systems, fertilizer supply systems, agricultural extension, input distribution, and capacity building, who work side-by-side with AGRA program officers in “Geographic Service Teams” across the region to help farmers increase their crop yields.\n",
      "The biggest hurdle to increasing farmer productivity in Africa today is the continued use of outdated production technologies and practices.  Nevertheless, broad experience has shown that Africa’s farmers – like farmers everywhere – will adopt new technologies when they are useful, affordable, and available locally.  Past investments by AGRA in plant breeding have yielded over 600 new crop varieties which are higher-yielding, resistant to local pests and diseases, and are more resilient in the face of environmental and climatic stress.  Meanwhile, AGRA’s collaborations with the African private sector have contributed to the establishment of over 100 private, independent seed companies and over 25,000 village-based agro-dealers.  Parallel initiatives in the development and marketing of new blends of fertilizer which are formulated to suit local soil types are now underway.\n",
      "Nevertheless, awareness of the value of this new technology at farmer level remains low, restricting both demand and supply.  Communicating to farmers the opportunity to improve their lives and livelihoods through the adoption of improved seed, fertilizer, and other inputs helps unleash demand at local levels.  Helping entrepreneurs and public officials to build systems that deliver high-quality inputs will allow input markets to grow to scale across the program area, at which point AGRA’s services will no longer be required.\n",

Over the course of a year, Fellows remain in their jobs while participating in five in-person, multi-day immersive seminars and engaging in online content between seminars. Currently operating in East Africa, India and Pakistan, the Fellows Program equips leaders from across the country or region with the knowledge, skills and community to become more effective, collaborative agents of change.\n",
      "Our Fellows Program centers around five in-person seminars design to improve individuals’ capacity to innovate and drive change while remaining in their full-time jobs.\n",
      "Our unique virtual content enables Fellows to connect with peers and continue developing the skills to make lasting social impact between seminars.\n",
      "We provide the space and security for Fellows to practice self-reflection, broaden their perspectives and identify areas for personal development.\n",
      "We design content that is focused on being relevant and applicable to Fellows’ everyday lives and social impact work.\n",
      "Based off the work of Harvard Professor Ron Heifitz, Adaptive Leadership is a practical leadership framework that helps individuals and organizations adapt and thrive in challenging environments. The content supports Fellows’ ability, both individually and collectively, to catalyze and embrace the gradual and meaningful process of change.\n",

The Fellows Program is designed for individuals who are currently leading, or are an integral part of building, an initiative that exists to eradicate poverty and/or injustice. Fellows are often on one of the following trajectories:\n",
      "+ Community Organizer/Activist: mobilizing communities and calling attention to unseen, unheard and/or marginalized communities or causes\n",
      "+ Intrapreneur: creating innovative solutions to tackle poverty from within existing institutions by shifting institutional culture and building new collaborations\n",
      "+ Organizational Builder: supporting the growth of poverty-focused institutions from within, but not as the Founder/CEO\n",
      "+ Public Sector Leader: leveraging the government to create policy changes, partnerships or adoption of new models to tackle poverty\n",
      "+ Social Entrepreneur: founded a for-profit or non-profit organization that provides critical goods/services to the underserved\n",

      "No. Although many of our Fellows work in social enterprise, Fellows can be working in any sector (for-profit, nonprofit, social enterprise, government).\n",
      "No. Fellows can be entrepreneurs who started their own organizations or intrapreneurs influencing change within existing organizations. They can be public sector leaders leveraging the government machinery to tackle poverty, or community leaders mobilizing change in their communities. We are looking for an entrepreneurial attitude, mind-set and approach – people who don’t accept the status quo.\n",
      "There are no specific academic prerequisites. However, Fellows must be able to fully participate in a program that is conducted in English.\n",
      "Yes. All seminars and trainings are conducted in English. Proficiency in English is a requirement to ensure Fellows are able to give and get the most from this experience.\n",
      "Yes. We consider applications from citizens of the country/region. We will also, on an exceptional basis, consider applicants who demonstrate a concrete connection to the region (i.e. long-term employment, residency, focus of social change project).\n",

      "Neither the markets nor aid alone can solve the problems of poverty. More than two billion people around the world lack access to basic goods and services—from clean water and electricity to an education and the freedom to participate in the economy. We’re here to change that. Our vision is a world based on dignity, where every human being has the same opportunity. Rather than giving philanthropy away, we invest it in companies and change makers.\n",
      "Acumen was incorporated on April 1, 2001, with seed capital from the Rockefeller Foundation, Cisco Systems Foundation and three individual philanthropists. Our desire was to transform the world of philanthropy by looking at all human beings as members of a single, global community where everyone had the opportunity to build a life of dignity. The organization would invest “Patient Capital,” capital that bridges the gap between the efficiency and scale of market-based approaches and the social impact of pure philanthropy, in entrepreneurs bringing sustainable solutions to big problems of poverty.\n",
      "Acumen CEO and Founder, Jacqueline Novogratz’s work began in 1986 when she quit her job on Wall Street to help open Rwanda’s first microfinance institution, Duterimbere—an experience that inspired her to write the bestseller, The Blue Sweater: Bridging the Gap between Rich and Poor, and create Acumen. Indeed, when she founded Acumen in 2001, few had heard of the words impact investing.\n",
      "When we first began, our vision was to create a venture capital fund for the poor, supported by a global community of philanthropists willing to take a bet on a new approach. We would call our donors “Partners” and treat them like investors because our approach would be to invest together in long-term change. Our Partners come from over 20 countries and include individuals and institutions who believe there’s a better way and are working together to challenge the status quo.\n",
      "We invest in early-stage companies whose products and services enable the poor to transform their lives. We also support our companies with the tools, networks, technical assistance and strategic guidance needed to succeed and scale into long-term solutions to poverty.\n",
      "We build leaders with the skills, determination and moral imagination to challenge the status quo. Our Fellows Program develops extraordinary individuals with the knowledge, support system and practical wisdom to unlock their full potential to drive social change.\n",
      "We launched +Acumen to offer world-class online courses so that anyone, anywhere can think differently, learn collaboratively and join a global community of learners and doers with a burning desire to change the world.\n"

      "We report our statement of activities as a nonprofit, reflecting contributed revenues and expenses – program and administrative – each year. Unlike most charities, however, we invest a substantial portion of our assets in entrepreneurial businesses that serve the poor. These investments, conceptually equivalent to the grants made by other nonprofits, stay on our balance sheet and are not reflected as part of our program expenses on our statement of activities.\n",
      "In 2016, Acumen raised $30.0 million in philanthropic capital, an increase of 26% from 2015. Of the $30.M, $5.0M represents a Partnership grant from the IKEA Foundation to expand our work in bringing off-grid energy solutions to the world’s poor. Acumen recognized non-cash revenue of $1.2 million, mostly in the form of donated legal services, primarily to support our investing work. We received $0.4 million in interest income from portfolio loans, and have a loss provision of $3.2 million for portfolio investment losses. Acumen carries our program investments at cost, and we lower these valuations when impairment exists. We review our portfolio of assets on an annual basis and apply a consistent valuation philosophy across the companies in our portfolio. Because we carry these investments at cost, we do not mark up our equity investments to fair market value, even when subsequent funding rounds imply an increase in the holding value of our investments. Any increase in value of equity investments would be recognized as realized gains or profits upon exit.\n",
      "Operating expenses represents all the direct costs related to the running of Acumen programs as well as our management and general and fundraising costs. They do not reflect any of our investments in our portfolio companies. Total expenses for 2016 were $19.9 million, a 7% increase compared to the prior year. Donated services comprise $3.0 million of the $19.9million total. Our increases reflect growth in a number of our program areas including our Portfolio team, our Leadership programs, and our +Acumen course offerings.\n",
      "Program work constitutes 75% of our total expenses. Portfolio expenses were $8.2 million, representing the cost of sourcing, due diligence, planning and the execution of $11.4 million in new and follow-on investment disbursements, as well as managing our active portfolio of 67 companies. Outreach, Impact and Communications expenses were $5.0 million, representing our work in measuring and reporting our investment performance (both financial and non-financial), and in the research and sharing of our insights on patient capital. Our Fellows programs have expanded in scope to $1.7 million in 2016 spend, with the Global Fellows program in its tenth year of existence. Fundraising costs and Management and General expense accounted for $5.0 million, which included investments in improving organization efficiency and effectiveness.\n",
      "Acumen’s total assets were $117.3 million as of December 31, 2016. Similar to a venture capital fund that raises cash upfront for a multi-year investing period, we ended the year in a strong cash position to support our programs across the organization. $14.4 million of the total balance was restricted and designated for specific programmatic uses or for use as investment capital. We seek to hold at least $10.0 million as our operating reserves.\n",
      "Total liabilities at the end of 2016 were $7.0 million, the majority of which were notes payable by Acumen Capital Markets (ACM) to ACM investors. Net assets at the end of the year were $117.3 million compared to $107.6 million at the end of 2015 – a 9.0% increase. There was a restatement of $0.9 million in the 2015 figures from net assets to liabilities (related to deferred revenue in India).\n",
      "Total liabilities at the end of 2015 were $6.5 million the majority of which are notes payable by Acumen Capital Markets (ACM) to ACM investors. Net assets at the end of the year were $108.5 million compared to $102.0 million at the end of 2014 – a 6.0% increase.\n",

We review our portfolio of assets on an annual basis and apply a consistent valuation philosophy across the companies in our portfolio. Because we carry these investments at cost, we do not mark up our equity investments to fair market value, even when subsequent funding rounds imply an increase in the holding value of our investments. Any increase in value of equity investments would be recognized as realized gains or profits upon exit.\n",
      "Operating expenses represents all the direct costs related to the running of Acumen programs as well as our management and general and fundraising costs. They do not reflect any of our investments in our portfolio companies. Total expenses for 2016 were $19.9 million, a 7% increase compared to the prior year. Donated services comprise $3.0 million of the $19.9million total. Our increases reflect growth in a number of our program areas including our Portfolio team, our Leadership programs, and our +Acumen course offerings.\n",
      "Program work constitutes 75% of our total expenses. Portfolio expenses were $8.2 million, representing the cost of sourcing, due diligence, planning and the execution of $11.4 million in new and follow-on investment disbursements, as well as managing our active portfolio of 67 companies. Outreach, Impact and Communications expenses were $5.0 million, representing our work in measuring and reporting our investment performance (both financial and non-financial), and in the research and sharing of our insights on patient capital. Our Fellows programs have expanded in scope to $1.7 million in 2016 spend, with the Global Fellows program in its tenth year of existence. Fundraising costs and Management and General expense accounted for $5.0 million, which included investments in improving organization efficiency and effectiveness.\n",
      "Acumen’s total assets were $117.3 million as of December 31, 2016. Similar to a venture capital fund that raises cash upfront for a multi-year investing period, we ended the year in a strong cash position to support our programs across the organization. $14.4 million of the total balance was restricted and designated for specific programmatic uses or for use as investment capital. We seek to hold at least $10.0 million as our operating reserves.\n",
      "Total liabilities at the end of 2016 were $7.0 million, the majority of which were notes payable by Acumen Capital Markets (ACM) to ACM investors. Net assets at the end of the year were $117.3 million compared to $107.6 million at the end of 2015 – a 9.0% increase. There was a restatement of $0.9 million in the 2015 figures from net assets to liabilities (related to deferred revenue in India).\n",
      "Total liabilities at the end of 2015 were $6.5 million the majority of which are notes payable by Acumen Capital Markets (ACM) to ACM investors. Net assets at the end of the year were $108.5 million compared to $102.0 million at the end of 2014 – a 6.0% increase.\n",

Traditional measurement tools, whether inherited from international development or impact investing, don’t make sense.

Those opportunities are generally in growth markets, but our focus is on the business not the economy.\n",
      "We invest in companies that will revolutionise financial inclusion. The relevant sub-sectors are microfinance, fintech, small and medium-sized banks, money operators, correspondent banking and peer-to-peer lenders. Our investments include ground-breaking P2P platforms such as KUBO in Mexico and correspondent banking models like MOVILRED in Colombia.\n",

      "Impact is not easily defined or standardised - it is often complex and sometimes debatable.  This is why context, intent and need are all factors that influence our understanding of what positive social and environmental impact is and how to achieve it.\n",
      "At Willow, we have chosen to adopt a proactive approach to impact. This means that we sometimes need to consciously find and design ways in which to create positive impact.\n",
      "Impactful businesses and SMEs are not all started by social entrepreneurs or designed with impact in mind. However, many are ideally positioned to transform their operations, with the objective of generating impact.\n",
      "\n",
      "The potential for generating and scaling up impact is at the heart of our approach. We consider each enterprise on its own impact merit and adapt our approach to ensure that we maximise that potential.\n",
      "Each case is different. We work with businesses to identify where and how impact can be generated. We put systems in place to do so and integrate these with the company's commercial operations. We monitor and measure the impact we generate.\n",
      "We build relationships with other actors in the sector such as Foundations, Civil Sector organisations and technical experts. We learn from their experience and best practices. We use every resource at our disposal to ensure that we have a thorough understanding of the impact issues relevant to the businesses that we work with.\n",

      "Mr. Harrington has provided advice and consulting services to numerous start-up and early stage companies, particularly in commercialization of renewable energy technologies.  He has consulted widely and provided training programs on capital attraction and governance as well as other topics in microfinance.  He has evaluated investment candidates and negotiated terms with microfinance institutions and operating companies.  He has authored and published papers on valuation, business planning and the role of foreign investment in microfinance.  He is an investor in social impact companies with a focus on India, Africa, and Central America as well as innovative technologies in the US.\n",
      "Much of Mr. Harrington’s microfinance work was conducted on behalf of MEDA, a leading international NGO with almost sixty years of experience in economic development in developing countries.  From 1990 to 1998, Mr. Harrington was with the Ben Franklin Technology Partners, an innovative public-private partnership which focuses on developing early stage companies with promising technologies.  Mr. Harrington was executive vice president and oversaw investments in a portfolio of over 200 companies through five investment funds.\n",
      "Mr. Harrington is a graduate of Lafayette College with a BS in mechanical engineering.  He has a master’s degree in city planning from the University of Pennsylvania.  He regularly serves as a judge of the business plan competition at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and is conversant in Spanish.  He is a member of the investment committee of the Patient Capital Collaborative.  His profile is available in LinkedIn.\n",

      "Impact investing combines the goals of philanthropy and finance which, in shorthand, can be considered to be ‘doing good while making money.’  It differs from philanthropy in which funds are donated.  It differs from socially responsible investing which applies a social or environmental ‘screen’ to the investment decision in addition to the normal considerations of risk and return.  Impact investing is often considered to be investing with a social or environmental mission.  Impact investing has grown to include not only individuals but pension funds, foundations, and commercial capital.\n",

      "In the course of our work with investors and entrepreneurs over the years, a number of lessons about the investing process have become apparent that can be helpful in various kind of industries and locations.  Among them are the following:\n",
      "✔  Seek investors for the long term.  Seek investors who bring more than money.  Seek investors who will be able to bring in other investors at a later date if that will be necessary.  Be specific about what talents and qualities they bring before entering the deal.\n",
      "✔  Be very careful about the valuation of the firm.  A valuation that is too high may make raising money difficult.  A valuation that is too low effectively reduces the amount that can be raised.\n",
      "✔  The investors will perform due diligence prior to an investment in the company.  Perform due diligence on the investors.  Ask to talk with their current portfolio companies.\n",
      "✔  Capital-raising will be an ongoing process, even if it’s only dealing with the investors that have been brought in.  Plan on it.\n",
      "✔  If possible, generate increasing sales and profits before seeking outside investors.  It will make the negotiation process much easier.\n",
      "✔  Assemble a competent and complete management team.  Management is the single attribute of the company that is most important to investors.  If that is not possible, be prepared to acknowledge its weaknesses and develop a plan or schedule for resolving them.\n",
      "✔  Many successful entrepreneurial firms develop strategic alliances with major players in the industry for the purpose of marketing its products.  The name recognition and experience of the larger partner will help in getting the product to market when the company is so young that it’s name is not likely to be well known and its industry contacts are few.  Investors are often impressed by strategic alliances.\n",
      "✔  Try to avoid a concentration of sales with a single customer if possible.  Be prepared for contingency plans if that customer’s business fails or is given to a competing firm.\n",
      "✔  Develop a business plan with the idea that it is a constantly evolving document.  It will always need to be updated in some way.  Do not prepare it solely to satisfy investors.\n",
      "✔  Maintain quality business and financial records.  Investors may avoid considering companies which cannot demonstrate clear and reasonable record-keeping as well as compliance with government authorities.\n",
      "✔  The entrepreneur needs to be somewhat competent in all aspects of the business.  Investors are likely to be impressed by entrepreneurs who are particularly knowledgeable about their customers.\n",
      "✔  A venture capital investment is a partnership between the investors and the management.  It is therefore important that management wants the involvement of the investors, not simply their capital.\n",
      "✔  The goals of the investor and the entrepreneur need to be aligned — although not necessarily the same.  They should discuss these early in the negotiation process to determine if their interests are compatible.  Agreement on the need for and the timing of an exit is key.\n",
      "✔  Quality deal flow is essential to having enough investment choices to make good decisions and create a viable fund.\n",
      "✔  The ability of the entrepreneur to penetrate the market (through distribution, direct sales or strategic alliances) is key.\n",
      "✔  A minority stake in the firm may be preferred.  It gives the entrepreneur the incentive to work hard and make the right decisions.  If the entrepreneur is not qualified, even owning a large stake in the firm may not be enough to make it a profitable deal.\n",
      "✔  The most likely exit opportunity may be a strategic sale.  The investor needs to be prepared to “open doors” to make that happen.\n",
      "✔  A minority investor may need protection against sale of assets, excessive compensation of executives, payment of dividends, etc.\n",
      "✔  Even if it’s necessary to help in preparing the business plan, make sure that the entrepreneur is deeply involved in the plan, rather than outside consultants.\n",
      "✔  Problems with valuation may be remedied with earn-out provisions.  The investor agrees to give back shares (i.e., accept a higher valuation for the company) if the entrepreneur is successful in meeting milestones related to sales, profits, etc. after the deal is completed.\n",
      "✔  The IRR of some investee companies is likely to erode over time.  Seek portfolio companies that can provide a 30% IRR in order to achieve 20% for the fund.\n",
      "✔  The most difficult investment decision is the second investment in a company that has not performed up to expectations.  “Good money after bad.”\n"

      "Gray Ghost Ventures is a pioneer of the global impact investing movement and continues to be innovative in furthering its expansion. As one of the earliest private investors in microfinance, GGV seeks to eliminate poverty and strengthen communities through catalytic, early-stage investments in the developing world by focusing on enabling technology, financial services, and other products and services concentrated on enhancing the quality of life for large, underserved populations in emerging markets.\n",
      "In 2005, Gray Ghost Ventures’ team of investment professionals was tasked by its founder to move beyond microfinance and subsequently founded the impact investment approach of creating equity infusions into technology platforms to truly empower and increase the productivity and income-generation ability of the low-income communities we serve. Thus in 2006, GGV launched a portfolio of mission-related investments on behalf of Gray Matters Capital (GMC). The team's investments focus on early-stage, venture capital investments that seek to improve the lives of the underserved via Information and Communications Technologies (ICT), Clean Tech, as well as other proven technologies. In 2008, based on opportunities realized in the market, the experience gained by the Investment team and its management track record, GGV formally established Gray Ghost Management & Operations (the Investment Manager) as a separate entity. The success of GMC's Mission-Related Portfolio led to the creation of the Gray Ghost DOEN Coöperatief in 2009, a fund charged with continuing the work that was started in 2006.  The Gray Ghost Emerging Markets Fund, GGV’s third fund, will launch late in 2014.\n",

      "At Business Partners, we have always believed that entrepreneurship is the most aspirational human endeavour of all. This very belief led to the establishment of our business, more than 33 years ago, to facilitate entrepreneurship through a comprehensive service offering of business finance, mentorship and business premises to Entrepreneurs in the small and medium enterprise (SME) space. We affectionately refer to Entrepreneurs as the “square pegs in round holes”, those exceptional individuals who see the world not for what it is, but for what it could be.\n",
      "South Africa, and indeed much of Africa and the world, needs more Entrepreneurs – especially those who start-up, establish and grow SMEs. Research has proven that entrepreneurial SMEs are very effective at stimulating economic growth, generating wealth and creating jobs – all of which are required for us to successfully combat unemployment and poverty which afflicts much of the world.\n",
      "To encourage more people to pursue entrepreneurship as a noble career, we must honour and celebrate Entrepreneurs as role-models – the true heroes of economic society who, often against all odds, generate wealth for themselves and their families and create jobs for many – and we must champion their cause.\n",
      "In 2012, we undertook research which revealed that our brand image no longer reflected who we are or what we do – Enabling successful entrepreneurship. We needed to make some changes in order to succinctly and adequately communicate our brand essence and remain successful. These changes would need to come in the form of process improvements, enhancement of our service offering and the repositioning of our brand.\n",
      "To this end, we are repositioning our company and launching an entrepreneurship marketing campaign with the specific intent of helping to foster and entrench a culture of entrepreneurship amongst all South Africans. We are using the repositioning exercise also present to the market a couple of SME Funds aimed at stimulating entrepreneurship.\n",
      "The new Business Partners corporate identity has been deliberately designed to reaffirm our commitment to and support for entrepreneurs, the “square pegs in a sea of round holes”. It is a step in a process to reignite the flame of entrepreneurship – encouraging more people to become entrepreneurs, the most aspirational human endeavour of all.\n",
      "At Business Partners, entrepreneurs are affectionately referred to as “square pegs in round holes”. We do so because we appreciate that they are special people, the exceptional few who see the world not for what it is, but for what it could be.\n",
      "Entrepreneurs almost always work against the grain, often challenging conformity, because they see the world through fresh eyes. Where others see problems and challenges, they see opportunities and turn them into solutions. They share an unwavering belief in their abilities and skills to solve problems, while fulfilling societal needs. Statistics show that only one in a handful of people possesses the qualities to be an entrepreneur. They are truly special. They are different.\n",
      "We, at Business Partners, exist to fulfil the needs and requirements of entrepreneurs, exclusively in the small and medium enterprise (SME) sector. We are passionate about entrepreneurs, entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial development.\n",
      "Square pegs are our business. We invest in them, stand beside them and champion their cause. Our talent lies in our ability to unearth entrepreneurs and help them transform their lives, as well as the lives of all those they touch through their entrepreneurial endeavours. Our strength lies in our ability to tailor-make our service offerings to suit each entrepreneur’s unique needs, thus becoming the best business partner they’ve ever had. Hard work and commitment to entrepreneurs underpins the spirit of Business Partners. By always facilitating finance opportunities and sharing knowledge, we are always building entrepreneurs.\n",
      "Our logo reflects not only the crux of who we are, but also of who we aim to serve – the entrepreneur. Or as we like to call them, the square pegs. The exceptional few who see the world not for what it is, but for what it could be.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first glance, one of the stylised objects is different from the rest. It stands out and is one of a kind – the square peg in the sea of round holes. This represents the rarity of people who possess the qualities necessary to be an entrepreneur.\n",
      "The ‘twist’ of the square peg further emphasises the distinctive, mould breaking character of the entrepreneur. This reflects not only the entrepreneurial qualities of the target market, but of Business Partners itself.\n",
      "Our colour palette comprises hues of blue and orange. Blue, as the predominant colour, represents expertise and trust. It is perceived as reliable and sincere, while exuding confidence.\n",
      "The square icon is a vibrant orange, and like the entrepreneur that it represents; it is bold and distinctive. Used sparingly, it further conveys that entrepreneurs are the exception. This colour is strongly associated with courage and gut instincts, key traits of any entrepreneur.\n",
      "A style of logotype using a forward slash has been brought into the name, serving to create further iconography and intellectual property.\n",
      "Modern and contemporary, our timeless and unique logo stands out in its arena. Just as an entrepreneur should.\n",
      "In striving to make entrepreneurship the most aspirational human endeavour of all, we have identified the Entrepreneurs Credo as being at the centre of our DNA.\n",
      "Our credo is taken from Thomas Paine’s ‘The Common Man’, written in 1776. It is an ageless piece of writing that speaks to the life choices and beliefs of an entrepreneur.\n",
      "This is a passage that speaks to who we are and who we aspire to be. The words articulate what runs in our blood, what inspires us to do what we do.\n",
      "Our brand mission is to enable successful entrepreneurship while our higher purpose is to foster a culture of entrepreneurship in South Africa, Africa and all markets where we have presence.\n",
      "In striving to make entrepreneurship the most aspirational human endeavour of all, we have identified the Entrepreneurs Credo as being at the centre of our DNA.\n",
      "Our story started in 1979 at a business conference in downtown Johannesburg. The late Dr. Anton Rupert – egged on by his son, Johann – proposed the idea for a joint venture between the public and private sectors to finance and support SMEs.\n",
      "Within two years, the Small Business Development Corporation Ltd (SBDC) was established, with both the public and private sectors having equal shareholding. The main role of the SBDC was to provide investment capital and business support to small, medium and micro enterprises (SMMEs). These beneficiary businesses could be a start-up, in the process of expansion, or one without access to capital markets. In short, the SBDC backed potential.\n",
      "The SBDC quickly gained a reputation for being first-class in its field, and by 1994, was referred to by The World Bank as “unmatched by any other financial institution in South Africa”. The dawn of South Africa’s democracy marked the commencement of a restructuring process for the SBDC. Extensive negotiations between its public and private sector shareholders resulted in the company narrowing its focus and market segment to SMEs only. The SBDC affirmed its position as an independent profit-making company with the vision of being the best value-adding provider of capital to SMEs in South Africa.\n",
      "Name Change – With the conclusion of the restructuring process came the decision to reconsider our name. And so in 1998, the Small Business Development Corporation Limited became Business Partners Limited. This repositioning process cemented our move into the niche SME market. This resulted in the introduction of innovative financing and investment products for SMEs, and the restructuring of the property portfolio to ensure that business premises would be made available at market-related rentals.\n",
      "Our new name ‘Business Partners’ reflects our relationship with our clients as well as our commitment, not only to investing in viable SMEs, but also to the contribution of much needed value-adding support services. It also expresses the partnership we form with the entrepreneurs we support.\n",
      "To ensure our relevance and strengthen our SME niche market position, we regularly review our business processes. We also undertake initiatives to raise awareness around our brand, increase understanding of our product and service offering and increase the number of investment deals and average deal size per annum.\n",
      "For our television commercial, in our quest make entrepreneurship the most aspirational human endeavour of all, we are using the Entrepreneurs Credo to unleash entrepreneurs to get the South African and African economies going and working for all. The credo is taken from Thomas Paine’s ‘The Common Man’, written in 1776. This ageless piece of writing that speaks to the life choices and beliefs of an entrepreneur. The credo has underpinned American economic well-being and galvanized that country to become the economic powerhouse with a strong entrepreneurship culture. We believe it can inspire Africans as well.\n",
      "Mariaan received a pharmaceutical degree from the University of Potchefstroom and, after entering the job market, rapidly moved up the ranks within a large pharmacy retail group. Despite being the most junior managing member, she was rated the top performing pharmacist within the group after two years. Her pharmacy was also the fastest growing and most profitable outlet within the organisation. During this period she received a nomination from Boehringer Ingelheim as ‘Pharmacist of the Year’. Due to her strong entrepreneurial desire, she soon left formal employment to help found the Medical Nutritional Institute.\n",
      "Mariaan’s approach to business strategy stems from her training in formal science. Focused on problem solving through critical thinking and experimentation, science dictates that one should refute rather than verify one’s theories. In 2013, Mariaan was nominated as a finalist in the category of Top Performing Entrepreneur (National Business Awards). She also received joint awards with her business partner as winner of the Innovator of the Year (Entrepreneur of the Year) and was a finalist in the categories of Fast growth SMME (National Business Awards) and Medium Business Entrepreneur (Entrepreneur of the Year).\n",
      "Medical Nutritional Institute (MNI) – Due to a desire to focus more on disease prevention than cure, Dr. Conrad Smith and pharmacist, Mariaan du Plessis, established the Medical Nutritional Institute (MNI) in 2002. The MNI services currently include the research, development and marketing of new pharmaceutical products, initiating and managing healthcare, as well as offering training services to pharmacies and pharmacy clinics.\n",
      "Over the years, the business owners noticed conventional medicine earning respect through its history of peer-reviewed scientific validation and natural or complementary medication, on the other hand, being negatively impacted by some poor-quality products with unsubstantiated marketing claims, a lack of efficacy and a largely unregulated industry. This resulted in the MNI developing a range of non-prescription medication from organic molecules that conformed to the specifications of local and international medicine regulatory boards. The business has since built its range substantially, with all products scientifically sound and able to withstand the scrutiny and scepticism of the mainstream pharmaceutical and medical world.\n",
      "Due to a strong entrepreneurial drive, Mariaan has taken on the role of Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the institute, while Conrad manages the role of product innovation and development. The innovative pair possesses a strong entrepreneurial flair and a good mind-set for business strategy and system development, which has resulted in the business expanding rapidly and setting its sights on select offshore markets. Both partners have also succeeded individually in the medical industry, and this success is evident in the various awards they have received in their medical and pharmaceutical professions to date.\n",
      "Through on-going research, development and progress, the MNI has established itself as a leading innovator in the development of complementary and non-prescription medication in South Africa and certain offshore territories.\n",
      "The concept for the mega appliance chain store, Hirsch’s, was formed many years ago when entrepreneur, Margaret Hirsch and her husband, Allan, started a family business in a tiny showroom in Durban with just R900. Since these humble beginnings the business has grown significantly and currently operates 12 stores and five concept stores which are located nationally and employ 785 staff members.\n",
      "When starting the appliance and electronics business in 1979, Margaret and Allan specialised in air conditioning and fridge repair, and later grew the offering and started selling new products to their loyal client base. The business, which is still family run, prides itself on personal and professional service, and believes that this specialised service is what differentiates them from their competitors. Their aim is to offer a premium service, which will result in a loyal clientele returning in the future.\n",
      "In addition to their expansive service capabilities, Margaret, who is the very hands on Chief Operations Officer of the company, attributes the business’s success to the fact that their offering adds value in the form of salespeople who have extensive product knowledge and who can offer significant discounts on the products. The business’s service offering and success resulted in them recently winning the Samsung award for the most improved sales in Africa as well as the People’s Choice Appliance, Electronics and Air-conditioning Company over the past few years.\n",
      "The business also offers clients additional services and benefits, such as a lay-buy purchasing system, which encourages clients to pay for products in cash, therefore not seeking additional debt in order to purchase appliances.\n",
      "According to Margaret, Hirsch’s staff is the most important component of the business and a significant driver of its success. She describes herself as a hands-on manager, and works very closely with staff. The business has a firm mentorship and a succession programme in place, where new staff is mentored by older staff, which assists with the transfer of skills to all levels of the business. In order to continue to evolve Hirsch’s service offerings and national footprint, its staff are continually valued and trained to encourage promotion from within the business wherever possible.\n",
      "Herman Mashaba’s academic dream was shattered in 1980 in his second year of a B. Admin. at the University of The North when the University was shut down due to political unrests. When the University was reopened after two months, he decided not to go back. Strong promises to send him out of the country for military training.\n",
      "Late in 1980 he found himself a clerical job with Spar Pretoria where he worked for 7 months. Then he worked for 23 months for Motani Industries, which became his longest and last salaried job.

      "Herman sold different products on a commission basis from the boot of his car for close to two years. Products portfolio ranged from insurance, fire detection systems, linen, crockery to dinner services.

Since making this decision he hasn’t looked back, despite significant challenges and the competitive industry that he operates in.\n",
      "Tommy’s first entrepreneurial journey began, when along with the help of his wife, he started a hair salon in QwaQwa. The line of salons grew successfully and resulted in him opening an additional six salons in four years.

He says that this venture however educated him, and the success of his next business, Bibi Cash and Carry is due to the experience he was exposed to.\n",
      "Bibi Cash and Carry, which is South Africa’s largest entirely black owned retail operation, has created jobs for 680 employees in a rural area, and contributes significantly towards its surrounding community by various social responsibility projects. Tommy says that the business has a competitive advantage over the bigger retail chains in the area due to his team’s superior local knowledge, its flexibility as a smaller regional player, and its determination to operate close to the townships and communities where most of its consumers reside.\n",
      "He also assists fellow entrepreneurs within the area by allowing smaller entrepreneurs to make use of the Bibi Cash and Carry brand name in exchange for support and access to their financials. The retailer also offers an in-house learnership programme to its staff, which transfers critical tools and skills to employees of all levels.\n",

      "Asia's stock markets opened the new trading week mixed, while the government shutdown continues in the USA after negotiations at Capitol Hill to agree on interim financing have failed so far. Given the limited direct impact on the US economy and the likelihood of an early agreement, capital markets are likely to take Washington's quarrels relatively relaxed. The Republican majority leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, put a vote on Monday afternoon (local time) for a draft that would ensure transitional financing for the government until February 8.\n",
      "Political tensions in Washington could cloud investors sentiment as a government shutdown is imminent if law makers cannot come to an agreement by midnight today. Even the House of Representatives passed a spending bill yesterday, democrats in the Senate could block the measure.\n",
      "The record hunt on Wall Street and in Tokyo continued, while European stock market indices were held back in part by the strength of the euro. The Nikkei, the leading Japanese index, has reached its highest level since November 1991.\n",
      "After the recent record levels, the majority of stock markets is dominated by profit-taking. In view of a scarcely pending economic agenda, the focus this week will be on the current corporate earnings season.\n",

      "Investisseurs & Partenaires (I&P) is an impact investing group fully dedicated to Sub-Saharan Africa. I&P gathers three impact funds representing €75 million and has supported more than 60 small and medium enterprises, located in 15 African countries.\n",
      "I&P was created in 2002 by Patrice Hoppenot, former co-founder of BC Partners and expert in private equity issues. In 2011, Jean-Michel Severino, previously CEO of the French Development Agency (2001-2010) and Vice-President of the World Bank for Asia (1996-2000), took over the management of the company. I&P currently employs about 30 people, based in Paris and six African local offices (Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Madagascar, Senegal)\n",
      "I&P’s mission is to contribute to the rise of a sustainable and dynamic private sector in Sub-Saharan Africa. Since the beginning, Investisseurs & Partenaires has aimed to support African entrepreneurs, able to build profitable and sustainable activities with high local added value. For this reason, I&P has developed a specific approach combining financial tools and strategic/operational support.\n",
      "I&P gathers different impact funds to support the growth of its partner companies, covering financing needs ranging from €30,000 to 1,5 million euros:\n",
      "Since 2000s, Sub-Saharan Africa countries have outperformed the rest of the world in terms of economic growth, with an annual GDP growth superior to 4.5% on average. By 2050, the GDP of Africa should be multiplied by 7, equaling China’s current GDP. Driven by a range of structural factors (demographics, macroeconomic policies…), this growth makes that Africa has become one of the most dynamic regions of the world.\n",
      "This dynamism should not however conceal the serious challenges the continent is facing, at social, political, environmental and economic levels: 41% of Sub-Saharan Africans live in extreme poverty, macro-economic trends are deteriorating because of the fall in commodity prices, the continent is struck by the impacts of climate change...\n",

I&P brings strategic coaching and develops Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) policies to support the growth of its partners and maximize their impacts.\n",

      "Contributing to the emergence of a new generation of African sustainable and responsible entrepreneurs and enterprises, following the best ESG practices, is at the heart of our mission.\n",
      "The investment process involves 5 key stages. Our approach is based on a rigorous methodology, which takes into account ESG (Environment, Social, and Governance) risks and opportunities throughout the investment cycle.\n",

      "I&P’s impact strategy is twofold, developed both at the company and at the portfolio level. This approach fosters the emergence of innovative and mutual ESG solutions for African SMEs. I&P targets the SMEs with a potential strong impact on their stakeholders: employees, clients, suppliers and distributors, local communities public authorities.\n",
      "One of I&P’s primary focus area, the development of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is key to dealing with the risks involved in African growth. Small and medium-sized African enterprises already play a major role in the economic landscape, and are involved in all sectors of the rural and urban economies. They also offer a guide to the growth conditions that will be dynamic, sustainable and fairly distributed.\n",
      "SMEs develop their activities by establishing partnerships with local suppliers and distributors. They therefore contribute to indirect job creation and play a significant role in organizing and assisting suppliers and distributors. I&P companies have mainly established contracts with local suppliers, and the purchase amount reached  €4,4 million (2014)\n",
      "I&P can act as catalytic financer in a context where SMEs encounter many difficulties to find long-term investment.\n",
      "In many cases, I&P assists the partner companies in their negotiations with other local or international financial institutions or in the search for new shareholder.\n",
      "Because they operate in the formal sector, the companies of the portfolio contribute to local development through the taxes generated by their activities. More than €6 million of taxes have been generated in 2014.\n",
      "Job creation is a major challenge for the African continent: 450 million more workers are expected by 2035, while 230 million jobs only should be created under the current conditions of growth. Generating good quality employment is a core objective for I&P, in line with the decent work agenda promoted by the International Labor Organization.\n",
      "Investee companies employ 3,000 people, including 1,570 jobs created after investment. The growth rate of these enterprises in terms of job creation is about 4 times higher than the rest of the economy.\n",
      "I&P’s policy is in line with the decent work agenda promoted by the International Labor Organization, so as to ensure there is no health or security-related risk.\n",
      "SMEs develop market-based solutions to answer local or national needs. They notably improve access to essential goods and services and help meet basic needs: medication, food products, building materials, etc. \n",
      "It has become a priority for the African continent to develop climate change mitigation strategies and to ensure a sustainable management of the natural resources. As an illustration, 3 million hectares of forest have disappeared yearly between 2000 and 2010 and 70M% of the halieutic reserves are now fully or overused.\n",

      "On a case by-case basis, I&P conducts an analysis of the environmental risks related to the company’s activities (water consumption, wastes) and implements a management strategy\n",
      "As the African continent is undergoing profound changes, it is of prior importance for I&P to promote the reality of African entrepreneurship and raise awareness about the role of impact investors in supporting small and medium enterprises.\n",

      "In partnership with  EY, the ANDE and INSEAD, I&P published the handbook “Investing in African SGBS”, available online.\n",
      "I&P edited a short document presenting an overview of its ESG & Impact Policy. As one of the pioneer impact investors in Sub-Saharan Africa, I&P has developed an extensive ESG and impact methodology, as briefly presented in the following document.\n",
      "The term \"Impact Investing\" appeared in the late 1990s to define, as stated by The Global Impact Investing Network, the “investments made into companies, organizations and funds with the intention to generate social and environmental impact alongside a financial return”. As explained by Jean-Michel Severino and Pierrick Baraton in a recent article on impact investing, \"the impact investor sets himself an impact objective in addition to his financial objective, and this is taken fully on board in the running of the company\".\n",
      "I&P has developed a specific methodology to evaluate the impacts of its partner companies on their stakeholders: employees, suppliers and distributors, clients, local communities, and public authorities.\n",
      "I&P collects and analyzes a set of impact metrics on all the companies of the portfolio. Several indicators have been defined to evaluate the impact on the company’s employees and their families, their clients and suppliers, and the local communities.\n",
      "Each year, I&P publishes the ESG & Impact Reporting, conceived as a comprehensive review of its fund IPAE societal strategy. The document presents the methodology in terms of ESG policy and impact measurement and examines the main results and achievements of IPAE partner companies over the year.\n",
      "I&P has contributed to EVPA's (European Venture Philanthropy Association) case studies in impact measurement. The document shows how I&P have developed their own impact measurement system and how it has dealt with issues such as proportionality, attribution and additionality.\n",

      "Investisseurs & Partenaires (I&P) and the Foundation for International Development Study and Research (FERDI) publish a study on impact investment in Africa, entitled “Investing in Africa’s development: how impact can contribute to meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Africa”. According to the study, impact investment offers a wide range of growth opportunities and represents an innovative and efficient answer to the development challenges of the continent.\n",
      "\"As part of this agenda, the UN put out a strong call to action for the private sector to play a fundamental role in achieving these goals. Indeed, the SDGs cannot be achieved without the active involvement of responsible businesses. The private sector will be essential in creating sustainable, productive and decent employment, economic prosperity, resilient infrastructure that underpins sustainable development and innovations that create green growth and opportunities for all, especially the poor. Impact investors can be at the forefront of addressing this challenge\"\n",
      "► The main characteristics of impact investors, and how they can contribute to solve development challenges\n",
      "► The landscape of impact investment in Africa: 19% of total assets under management in 2015 has been disbursed in Sub-Saharan Africa (the second largest amount worldwide, behind North America), but a very limited number of countries and sectors benefitted from it\n",
      "► How Impact Investment can contribute to meeting the SDGs in Africa, grouped into 8 main “SDG investment areas” where the private sector can play a key role: 1) Fighting poverty and inequalities, 2) Agriculture, Nutrition and Food Security, 3) Healthcare, Water and Sanitation, 4) Education, 5) Energy Access, 6) Infrastructure and Innovation, 7) Sustainable cities and 8) Environment and Biodiversity\n",
      "Investisseurs & Partenaires published the handbook \"Investing in Africa's Small and Growing Businesses\", a new tool to foster the development of early-stage SME investment in Africa and encourage the rise of new investors on the continent.\n",
      "The lessons learned by 6 investors that have collectively invested several hundred million euros in African SGBs\n",
      "The testimonials of 10 African entrepreneurs who share their feedbacks about their partnerships with investors\n",
      "The methodology of equity investment to target small and medium-sized enterprises explained in 11 key points\n",
      "Designed in partnership with Ernst & Young, the Aspen Network of Development Entrepreneurs and INSEAD Business Schools, and funded by The Rockefeller Foundation and The Tony Elumelu Foundation, the handbook is intended for investors, entrepreneurs and anyone interested in the field of SME financing in Africa.\n",
      "As stated by Jean-Michel Severino, \"the primary objective of this handbook is to provide an operative document for the future investment companies of the continent\"\n",
      "Initiated by the photographer Joan Bardeletti and Investisseurs & Partenaires, \"Small is Powerful\" aims to show a new facet of the African continent and to demonstrate the key role played by the small and medium-size enterprises for the development of the continent. \n",
      "The project follows five SMEs, operating across the continent in various sectors: Agrisatch, a local producer of good-quality eggs in Benin, Centrale du Solaire (CDS) in Mauritania, which provides access to water and electricity in rural area, the Senegalese clinic NEST, dedicated to the care of woman and child, Indian Ocean Trepang (IOT), specialized in the breeding of sea cucumbers in Madagascar and Wecyclers in Nigeria, which provides an innovative recycling service in Lagos.\n",
      "As an analytical and visual project, Small is Powerful gathers impact studies and on-site reportages. The project focuses on the entrepreneurs and office life, but also assesses the impacts these enterprises have on their environment and their stakeholders (job creation, infrastructure, improvement of living conditions…)\n",
      "Before each reportage, there is extensive preparatory work with the SMEs, filling in an impact assessment matrix specifically drawn up by the project team and based on EU recommendations in the domain. The study questions the impacts of the company on its ecosystem (employees, clients, suppliers, local communities…). The contents of the matrix constitute a check-list which then guides the visual production (photo and video) during a 10-day reportage on-site.\n",

      "Standing as one of the first impact investor in Africa, I&P partners with African SMEs by taking direct stakes as a minority shareholder. I&P brings strategic coaching and develops Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) policies to support the growth of its partners and maximize their impacts.\n",
      "I&P is an active partner bringing its skills in management, strategy and finance with an entrepreneurial approach. Our model hinges entirely upon the entrepreneur, with whom we wish to establish a long-term relationship based on trust and sincerity.\n",
      "Capacity building and training in a variety of fields based on the investee business specific needs: management information system, industrial/technological, sales/marketing, organization/HR, training/governance, etc.  \n",
      "Contributing to the emergence of a new generation of African sustainable and responsible entrepreneurs and enterprises, following the best ESG practices, is at the heart of our mission.\n",
      "The investment process involves 5 key stages. Our approach is based on a rigorous methodology, which takes into account ESG (Environment, Social, and Governance) risks and opportunities throughout the investment cycle.\n",
      "→ Develop an action plan for ESG improvements, with actions required, timeframe, proposed responsibilities and costs involved\n",
      "→ Check the reputation and track-record of potential purchasers, in cooperation with the entrepreneurs\n",
      "As an impact investor, I&P endeavors to achieve economic, social, and governance impacts through its investments. \n",
      "I&P’s impact strategy is twofold, developed both at the company and at the portfolio level. This approach fosters the emergence of innovative and mutual ESG solutions for African SMEs. I&P targets the SMEs with a potential strong impact on their stakeholders: employees, clients, suppliers and distributors, local communities public authorities.\n",
      "One of I&P’s primary focus area, the development of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is key to dealing with the risks involved in African growth. Small and medium-sized African enterprises already play a major role in the economic landscape, and are involved in all sectors of the rural and urban economies. They also offer a guide to the growth conditions that will be dynamic, sustainable and fairly distributed.\n",
      "SMEs develop their activities by establishing partnerships with local suppliers and distributors. They therefore contribute to indirect job creation and play a significant role in organizing and assisting suppliers and distributors. I&P companies have mainly established contracts with local suppliers, and the purchase amount reached  €4,4 million (2014)\n",
      "I&P can act as catalytic financer in a context where SMEs encounter many difficulties to find long-term investment.\n",
      "In many cases, I&P assists the partner companies in their negotiations with other local or international financial institutions or in the search for new shareholder.\n",
      "Because they operate in the formal sector, the companies of the portfolio contribute to local development through the taxes generated by their activities. More than €6 million of taxes have been generated in 2014.\n",
      "Job creation is a major challenge for the African continent: 450 million more workers are expected by 2035, while 230 million jobs only should be created under the current conditions of growth. Generating good quality employment is a core objective for I&P, in line with the decent work agenda promoted by the International Labor Organization.\n",
      "Investee companies employ 3,000 people, including 1,570 jobs created after investment. The growth rate of these enterprises in terms of job creation is about 4 times higher than the rest of the economy.\n",
      "I&P’s policy is in line with the decent work agenda promoted by the International Labor Organization, so as to ensure there is no health or security-related risk.\n",
      "SMEs develop market-based solutions to answer local or national needs. They notably improve access to essential goods and services and help meet basic needs: medication, food products, building materials, etc. \n",
      "It has become a priority for the African continent to develop climate change mitigation strategies and to ensure a sustainable management of the natural resources. As an illustration, 3 million hectares of forest have disappeared yearly between 2000 and 2010 and 70M% of the halieutic reserves are now fully or overused.\n",
      "We are convinced that African SMEs can play an active role on these issues, by experiencing and sharing innovative and replicable solutions.\n",
      "I&P proposes energy related operational improvements and collaborates with experts on the subject to implement these solutions\n",
      "Greenhouse gas emissions are measured annually and I&P supports its investees in the implementation of carbon offset strategy\n",
      "On a case by-case basis, I&P conducts an analysis of the environmental risks related to the company’s activities (water consumption, wastes) and implements a management strategy\n",
      "As the African continent is undergoing profound changes, it is of prior importance for I&P to promote the reality of African entrepreneurship and raise awareness about the role of impact investors in supporting small and medium enterprises.\n",
      "I&P is a member of the GIIN, ANDE, EVPA and AVCA, and takes part to the main meetings related to impact investing and African development.\n",
      "I&P initiated, with the photographer Joan Bardeletti, the project Small is Powerful. the project studies 5 SMEs and investigates the role they play on the development of the continent.\n",
      "In partnership with  EY, the ANDE and INSEAD, I&P published the handbook “Investing in African SGBS”, available online.\n",
      "I&P edited a short document presenting an overview of its ESG & Impact Policy. As one of the pioneer impact investors in Sub-Saharan Africa, I&P has developed an extensive ESG and impact methodology, as briefly presented in the following document.\n",
      "The term \"Impact Investing\" appeared in the late 1990s to define, as stated by The Global Impact Investing Network, the “investments made into companies, organizations and funds with the intention to generate social and environmental impact alongside a financial return”. As explained by Jean-Michel Severino and Pierrick Baraton in a recent article on impact investing, \"the impact investor sets himself an impact objective in addition to his financial objective, and this is taken fully on board in the running of the company\".\n",
      "I&P has developed a specific methodology to evaluate the impacts of its partner companies on their stakeholders: employees, suppliers and distributors, clients, local communities, and public authorities.\n",
      "I&P collects and analyzes a set of impact metrics on all the companies of the portfolio. Several indicators have been defined to evaluate the impact on the company’s employees and their families, their clients and suppliers, and the local communities.\n",
      "Each year, I&P publishes the ESG & Impact Reporting, conceived as a comprehensive review of its fund IPAE societal strategy. The document presents the methodology in terms of ESG policy and impact measurement and examines the main results and achievements of IPAE partner companies over the year.\n",
      "I&P has contributed to EVPA's (European Venture Philanthropy Association) case studies in impact measurement. The document shows how I&P have developed their own impact measurement system and how it has dealt with issues such as proportionality, attribution and additionality.\n",
      "Once a year, I&P conducts in-depth impact studies on one or several companies, based on field research. The studies focus on the social and economic impacts of the companies.\n"

Driven by a range of structural factors (demographics, macroeconomic policies…), this growth makes that Africa has become one of the most dynamic regions of the world.\n",

I&P brings strategic coaching and develops Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) policies to support the growth of its partners and maximize their impacts.\n",
      "I&P is an active partner bringing its skills in management, strategy and finance with an entrepreneurial approach. Our model hinges entirely upon the entrepreneur, with whom we wish to establish a long-term relationship based on trust and sincerity.\n",

      "Contributing to the emergence of a new generation of African sustainable and responsible entrepreneurs and enterprises, following the best ESG practices, is at the heart of our mission.\n",
      "The investment process involves 5 key stages. Our approach is based on a rigorous methodology, which takes into account ESG (Environment, Social, and Governance) risks and opportunities throughout the investment cycle.\n",
      "→ Develop an action plan for ESG improvements, with actions required, timeframe, proposed responsibilities and costs involved\n",
      "→ Check the reputation and track-record of potential purchasers, in cooperation with the entrepreneurs\n",
      "As an impact investor, I&P endeavors to achieve economic, social, and governance impacts through its investments. \n",
      "I&P’s impact strategy is twofold, developed both at the company and at the portfolio level. This approach fosters the emergence of innovative and mutual ESG solutions for African SMEs. I&P targets the SMEs with a potential strong impact on their stakeholders: employees, clients, suppliers and distributors, local communities public authorities.\n",
      "One of I&P’s primary focus area, the development of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is key to dealing with the risks involved in African growth. Small and medium-sized African enterprises already play a major role in the economic landscape, and are involved in all sectors of the rural and urban economies. They also offer a guide to the growth conditions that will be dynamic, sustainable and fairly distributed.\n",
      "SMEs develop their activities by establishing partnerships with local suppliers and distributors. They therefore contribute to indirect job creation and play a significant role in organizing and assisting suppliers and distributors. I&P companies have mainly established contracts with local suppliers, and the purchase amount reached  €4,4 million (2014)\n",
      "I&P can act as catalytic financer in a context where SMEs encounter many difficulties to find long-term investment.\n",
      "In many cases, I&P assists the partner companies in their negotiations with other local or international financial institutions or in the search for new shareholder.\n",
      "Because they operate in the formal sector, the companies of the portfolio contribute to local development through the taxes generated by their activities. More than €6 million of taxes have been generated in 2014.\n",
      "Job creation is a major challenge for the African continent: 450 million more workers are expected by 2035, while 230 million jobs only should be created under the current conditions of growth. Generating good quality employment is a core objective for I&P, in line with the decent work agenda promoted by the International Labor Organization.\n",
      "Investee companies employ 3,000 people, including 1,570 jobs created after investment. The growth rate of these enterprises in terms of job creation is about 4 times higher than the rest of the economy.\n",
      "I&P’s policy is in line with the decent work agenda promoted by the International Labor Organization, so as to ensure there is no health or security-related risk.\n",
      "SMEs develop market-based solutions to answer local or national needs. They notably improve access to essential goods and services and help meet basic needs: medication, food products, building materials, etc. \n",
      "It has become a priority for the African continent to develop climate change mitigation strategies and to ensure a sustainable management of the natural resources. As an illustration, 3 million hectares of forest have disappeared yearly between 2000 and 2010 and 70M% of the halieutic reserves are now fully or overused.\n",

      "The term \"Impact Investing\" appeared in the late 1990s to define, as stated by The Global Impact Investing Network, the “investments made into companies, organizations and funds with the intention to generate social and environmental impact alongside a financial return”. As explained by Jean-Michel Severino and Pierrick Baraton in a recent article on impact investing, \"the impact investor sets himself an impact objective in addition to his financial objective, and this is taken fully on board in the running of the company\".\n",
      "I&P has developed a specific methodology to evaluate the impacts of its partner companies on their stakeholders: employees, suppliers and distributors, clients, local communities, and public authorities.\n",
      "I&P collects and analyzes a set of impact metrics on all the companies of the portfolio. Several indicators have been defined to evaluate the impact on the company’s employees and their families, their clients and suppliers, and the local communities.\n",
      "Each year, I&P publishes the ESG & Impact Reporting, conceived as a comprehensive review of its fund IPAE societal strategy. The document presents the methodology in terms of ESG policy and impact measurement and examines the main results and achievements of IPAE partner companies over the year.\n",
      "I&P has contributed to EVPA's (European Venture Philanthropy Association) case studies in impact measurement. The document shows how I&P have developed their own impact measurement system and how it has dealt with issues such as proportionality, attribution and additionality.\n",
      "Once a year, I&P conducts in-depth impact studies on one or several companies, based on field research. The studies focus on the social and economic impacts of the companies.\n"

      "We receive inquiries and requests for funding every day of the week. Meeting entrepreneurs, understanding their plans and dreams is a core part of our day-to-day work. We love it.\n",
      "We’re inspired by the creativity, ambition and character of entrepreneurs working to solve big problems in big markets. The fun and focus of our work is partnering with entrepreneurs to bring their ideas to life and multiply their impact.\n",
      "Some entrepreneurs spend weeks and months writing lengthy business plans to submit to us and other investment firms. Others send a short teaser hoping for a meeting. Still others just send an email asking for funds. This note offers some advice as you think about approaching us and other investors. Our hope is that it will be a helpful guide to you whether or not we ever meet.\n",
      "The first thing to say is this: we don’t have an application form. We don’t make investment decisions by ticking boxes. Our investment decisions are inevitably subjective, and the key criterion for us as an early –stage investor is the character, clarity, capacity and ambition of the entrepreneurial team. We invest in people first, plans second. For more on what we look for in the entrepreneurial team see What Novastar Looks for in an Entrepreneur.\n",
      "Having said that, we are looking for clarity and conviction about the market opportunity you’re pursuing and how you are going about it. We suggest you take some time to test the rigor and clarity of your thinking on the key topics below. Your ideas and experience with these are what interests us.\n",
      "Mission: Why does your company exist? What is its purpose? Take time to hone it down to a single declarative sentence. One sentence. Seriously. If you can’t express your mission simply, it is probably too complex to succeed.\n",
      "Team: Who are you and why have you embarked on this exciting but difficult adventure? Motivation and a demonstrated capacity to execute (at more or less anything) is more important than impressive qualifications. We’re trying to assess character, capacity and ambition. How will you respond when things go wrong? Will you know when to persevere and when to pivot?\n",
      "Market: Who is your intended customer? Paint a portrait for us. How many of these customers are there? Are you pursuing a niche strategy or one that addresses a mass market in East Africa?\n",
      "Problem: What is the problem your customer currently experiences that your business will address? Is the problem you are trying to solve a serious pain to the customer? How does the customer currently address the pain?\n",
      "Solution: What is your solution to the problem? What is your product or service and how well is it suited to the market? Why is your solution better than the alternatives available to your customer?\n",
      "Innovation: What is the central innovation that makes your solution better than anything else available? What is the essence of your ‘unfair advantage’ over the competition?\n",
      "Business Model: How do you make money? What are the primary revenue and profit drivers in your business? What are the key risks in your business model?\n",
      "Efficiency: We want to partner with entrepreneurs who treat Novastar’s money like they would their own. We look for teams who deploy capital to achieve the greatest possible progress for every dollar spent. We expect some ideas and initiatives to fail before your company succeeds. The question here is: how are you going to make sure that those failures happen early and cheaply?\n",
      "Milestones: What is the pathway for developing your business? What key assumptions are you testing? How much capital will you need to achieve each of your milestones? We pay little attention to detailed financial models until the business matures. We want to understand the basic economics of the business you’re building and the milestones you have set to prove the underlying assumptions.\n",
      "Exit: We are patient, long-term investors, but we eventually need to achieve an exit from our investment. Are you committed to selling a controlling stake in your business down the road? Who would be the buyers? Why would they pay a strategic price to buy your company?\n",

We are buying the best components and selling them to low-income customers, with just a 20 percent deposit payment.

Equity can stimulate further debt capital, and so this equity investment by two partners who share our vision, is so welcome. It will allow us to do what we are doing, better, and to do it with many more people”.\n",

      "Novastar is a venture capital fund manager dedicated to supporting exceptional entrepreneurs building innovative businesses to profitably serve aspiring mass market consumers in East Africa. These ‘New Entrepreneurial Stars’ are catalysts for innovation, accountability, efficiency and accumulation of wealth for the common good.\n",
      "We manage an $80 million fund, but do not think of ourselves primarily as fund managers. The fun and focus of our work is partnering with entrepreneurs to help bring ideas to life and multiply their impact.\n",
      "We look for market potential, focused strategies (there is more than enough complexity in execution when growing a business in frontier markets), business model innovation, and a fundamental alignment between commercial success and positive social impact. But the quality of the founders trumps these.\n",
      "We invest in people first, plans second. Why? When assessing an early stage venture, the only thing certain about the business plan is that it is wrong. Neither we, nor the founders, yet know exactly where it’s wrong, but there are inevitably assumptions that will prove incorrect. The quality of the founding team, their resilience, courage and insight to make course corrections is paramount.\n",
      "We back entrepreneurs with character, capacity and ambition to build businesses that can transform markets and grow rapidly to scale. Our assessment is not formulaic; what follows is not a checklist. We inevitably make subjective judgments about entrepreneurs we meet. Hopefully the characteristics outlined below stimulate further thought and self-reflection.\n",
      "Such capacity is rarely embodied in one individual. We look for strong founding teams with\n",
      "complementary skills and experience.\n",
      "We back entrepreneurs who are not content to build sustainable SMEs. “Novastars” have ambition to tackle challenging problems in vast, underserved markets and grow large businesses. In due course, they will be prepared to sell a controlling stake to a strategic investor with capacity to grow the business further and enhance its value to all stakeholders.\n",
      "We are interested in doing the right things to build long-term value in businesses that respect and benefit all stakeholders.  We look for entrepreneurs whose ambition is deeper than fame or fortune. We want assurance that our values and motivations are shared by the entrepreneur(s), so that we are all pulling in the same direction.\n",
      "We expect a portion of our investments to fail. In one sense, our role in the financing ecosystem is to lower the cost of failure, enable iteration and learning, and signal commercial potential and success. This high-risk investment strategy that embraces failures means our winners must succeed at a very large scale. While we bask in some of the reflected glory, the key to our success is the character, capacity and ambition of the entrepreneurs we back.\n",

      "Time and money are inevitably in short supply for the start-up. We are investors who can move quickly. And if we decide not to invest we’ll give constructive feedback right away.\n",
      "Novastar is a multi-round investor with flexibility and firepower. We are prepared to invest as little as $100,000 in an unproven business model with high potential. And Novastar can fuel the rapid growth stage of the business through multiple capital rounds with up to $6 million. \n",

      "In addition to these project-based criteria, the EIB’s contributions are also assessed, notably what financial value added is brought about compared to alternatives, as well as how the Bank manages the project cycle from beginning to end and any other contribution that may have been made. This aspect of the evaluation is rated separately from the overall study, though it does form part of it. The Bank also uses its self-assessment to consider its own practices.\n",
      "A process of consultation is carried out before EV reports (thematic and their component individual parts) are finalised.  Recommendations are included in the reports, and EIB Management is bound to provide an official reply to these recommendations.\n",
      "A detailed timeline of the phases of our thematic evaluations can be found here, and evaluation of projects normally takes place between 18 months and three years after completion, allowing for a wider overall view.\n",
      "In accordance with the Evaluation Cooperation Group principles used by IFIs, operations are rated on a four level scale. These are 4 – excellent, 3 – satisfactory, 2 – partially unsatisfactory and 1 – unsatisfactory.\n",
      "This mandate specifies EV objectives and role while regulating its relations with the EIB Group; it officialises current practices and reflects the aim of the EIB Group to guarantee the independance of EV activities.\n",

      "The grant can be used to finance costs related to feasibility and market studies, programme structuring, business plans, energy audits and financial structuring, as well as to the preparation of tendering procedures, contractual arrangements and project implementation units.\n",
      "The ELENA facility is led by a team of experts consisting of engineers and economists with extensive experience in the transport and energy sector. Established in 2009, the ELENA facility has awarded around EUR 100 million of EU support triggering an estimated investment of around EUR 4 billion on the ground. You can find more information about completed and ongoing projects.\n",
      "Typically, ELENA supports programmes above EUR 30 million with a 3-year implementation period for energy efficiency and  4-year for urban transport and mobility, and can cover up to 90% of technical assistance/project development costs. Smaller projects can be supported when they are integrated into larger investment programmes.\n",
      "The annual grant budget is currently around EUR 20 million. Projects are evaluated and grants allocated on a first-come-first-served basis. ELENA may co-finance investment programmes in the following fields:\n",
      "Energy Cities created a study focused on how ELENA can help unlock investment in cities. The study found that ELENA can be beneficial to trigger investment for climate action in cities by providing the necessary push for cities and local authorities to change the way they plan their investments, and develop projects to achieve their climate objectives.\n",
      "The EIB welcomes contact from potential new clients. To submit an initial proposal for funding, contact us directly by email at elena@eib.org. If your project is selected for full appraisal, you will need to complete the ELENA Application Form for Energy projects or the ELENA Application Form for Mobility projects, as well as the declaration by the applicant.

      "Put simply, a public-private partnership (“PPP”) is an arrangement between a public authority and a private partner designed to deliver a public infrastructure project and service under a long-term contract. Under this contract, the private partner bears significant risks and management responsibilities. The public authority makes performance-based payments to the private partner for the provision of the service (e.g. for the availability of a road) or grants the private partner a right to generate revenues from the provision of the service (e.g. tolls from users of a bridge). Private finance is usually involved in a PPP. When properly prepared, PPP projects can provide significant benefits to the public sector as well as to the project users.\n",

      "The EIB gives priority to the following types of projects in these countries: 1) climate change mitigation and adaptation (e.g. renewable energy, energy efficiency, urban transport and other projects that reduce CO2 emissions); 2) development of social and economic infrastructure, including water and sanitation; 3) local private sector development, in particular support to SMEs. In addition, to be eligible for Bank financing, projects are required to have good potential to contribute to the economic development of the beneficiary country.\n",
      "Projects with a total investment above EUR 25m can be financed either directly to a project promoter or indirectly through a government or financial intermediary. Project promoters are required simply to provide the Bank's Operations Directorate with a detailed description of their capital investment together with the prospective financing arrangements. The total investment of a typical project under the ALA 2014-2020 mandate is above EUR 40m.\n",
      "For smaller projects the EIB can provide credit lines to selected financial institutions, which then on-lend the funds mainly to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

      "The EIB is the lending arm of the European Union owned by its 28 Member States and is the world’s biggest multilateral lender. Since opening its doors in March 1958 it has invested in thousands of companies and projects, from start-ups to massive programmes like the Øresund Bridge linking Sweden and Denmark.\n",
      "With more than 11 900 sustainable investment projects in around 162 countries, the EIB is turning good intentions into reality.\n",
      "The Bank was founded to mobilise capital, promote cohesion in Europe and modernise the economy. The EIB targets investments that support growth and job creation. To ensure maximum impact, the EIB lends to sound projects, combining EU funds with its loans.\n",
      "Since 1958 the EIB has been processing loans not only for telecommunications, transport and energy but also for industries undergoing conversion. Today, the Bank also supports sustainable investment in small and medium-sized enterprises, innovation, infrastructure, and climate and environment.\n",
      "The EIB’s work does not stop at the borders of Europe. The Bank has been active across the globe for over 50 years with projects in the Eastern and Southern neighbourhood of Europe, in African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, and in Asia and Latin America.\n",
      "The Investment Plan for Europe aims to make this a decade in which small and medium-sized businesses and innovative technologies find financial backing that might previously have been denied. A special capital increase allowed us to raise our support to the economic recovery and have considerable impact on the lives of citizens.\n",
      "In 2007 the EIB issued the world’s first Green Bonds. Its mission? Raise more money to fight climate change, by financing projects in the field of renewable energy and energy efficiency. We also supported big science innovations, such as the final phase of construction of the large hadron collider at CERN, aimed at reproducing the conditions that existed at the beginning of the Big Bang.\n",
      "Urban regeneration projects were a focus for EIB operations during these years, when the Bank started to provide financing to Eastern European countries after the fall of the Berlin wall. A decade of firsts: first operations in euros, first investments in Gaza/West Bank, first activities in South Africa.\n",
      "Financing innovative European companies as well as strategic infrastructure that can connect the common European market has been a goal since EIB’s inception. During these years, the Bank moved to its new Luxembourg headquarters in Kirchberg, and issued its first operation in ecus.\n",
      "In 1968 the European Investment Bank moved its headquarters from Brussels to Luxembourg. The first external offices were also inaugurated, starting with Brussels and Rome. The Bank focused mainly on financing strategic infrastructure, as well as on supporting the European industry in response to the energy crisis.\n",
      "Amid the splendour of Michelangelo’s architectural innovations, six European countries signed the Treaty of Rome, which founded the European Investment Bank in 1958. Four years after its inception, the Bank was authorised to finance projects also outside the European Community. This marked the beginning of the extension of EIB’s activities around the globe.\n",

      "We generally finance one-third of each project, but it can be as much as 50%. This long-term, supportive financing encourages private and public sector investors to put in their funds.\n",
      "All the projects we finance must be bankable. But they also must comply with strict technical, environmental and social standards. Our corps of 300 engineers and economists screens every project, before, during and after we lend. We’re accountable to EU citizens.\n",

      "In 2012 our shareholders, the EU Member States, agreed to a capital increase for the EIB Group. In return they asked us to lend an additional EUR 60 billion. This additional lending has allowed us to increase our support to the economic recovery in Europe and have considerable impact on the lives of citizens.\n",

Part of this initiative is the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI), launched jointly by the EIB Group and the European Commission. EFSI provides funding for economically viable projects where it adds value, including projects with a higher risk profile than ordinary EIB activities.\n",

We work to overcome concerns that traffic-dependent revenue (tolls, fares etc.) may not reach medium term targets.

Once the EIB has become a creditor, amounts due under the LGTT will rank junior to other debt. This support substantially enhances credit quality, thereby encouraging a reduction of risk margins applied to senior project loans.

      "In view of recent developments in the area of taxation (including the OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project and the European Union Anti-Tax Avoidance Package) the European Investment Bank Group (EIB Group) has taken additional measures to enhance its procedures and practices aimed at avoiding EIB Group operations being misused for tax fraud, tax evasion, tax avoidance, aggressive tax planning, money laundering and financing of terrorism purposes.\n",
      "The mission of the EIB Group, consisting of the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Investment Fund (EIF) is to contribute, by financing sound investments, to the policy objectives of the EU, as laid down in its statutes and in decisions of the European Council. The EIB Group contributes towards the integration, balanced development and economic and social cohesion of the EU Members States. Outside the EU, the EIB Group supports the EU policies on development aid and cooperation.\n",
      "As the financing institution of the European Union, the EIB Group attaches high importance to its compliance and controls framework. Reputational and Compliance risks as well as the mitigation of such risks are hence critical for the EIB Group.\n",

      "The EIB Group places great emphasis on integrity and good governance and is committed that its policies and procedures to avoid misuse of EIB Group operations for purposes of tax fraud, tax evasion, tax avoidance, aggressive tax planning, harmful tax practices, money laundering and financing of terrorism are in line with the principles and standards of applicable EU legislation, best banking practices and applicable market standards1.\n",
      "In this process, and more particularly for tax-related issues, the EIB Group relies on and conforms to the lists of non-compliant jurisdictions and country assessments produced from time to time by the European Union (EU), the United Nations and international standard-setting organisations including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Financial Stability Board, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes (“Lead Organisations”).\n",
      "As EU body, the EIB Group works closely with the European Commission and fully supports the recent regulatory and policy initiatives at EU level expressed in the Anti-Tax Avoidance Package (ATAP)2  and the 4th AML- CFT Directive3, including the reference to “high risk third countries”, which build on principles enshrined in the OECD Base erosion and profit shifting action plan (BEPS) and the FATF’s recommendations4 respectively. Given that the EIB Group expects its counterparties to comply with all applicable legislation and considering that the Bank is active both inside and outside of the EU, it is important for the Bank that international regulations and standards are aligned and create a uniform level of protection against tax fraud, tax evasion, tax avoidance, harmful tax practices, money laundering or terrorist financing throughout the EU and internationally.\n",
      "EIB Group is conscious of the crucial importance of the global developments and action to fight tax secrecy, tax evasion, tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning. In this context, the EIB Group welcomes the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance initiative including the creation of a common EU list of third country jurisdictions that fail to comply with tax good governance standards. The list is envisaged to be endorsed by the Council of the EU by the end of 2017 following dialogues with targeted jurisdictions to allow them to update their legal frameworks and procedures. \n",
      "In accordance with its nature and policies the EIB Group is inherently committed to comply with the EU Framework and the EU list, once adopted, will be therefore automatically incorporated in the EIB policy framework, prevailing over other Lead Organisations’ lists in case of conflict.\n",
      "  \n",
      "Before taking a decision to invest, projects are analysed on a risk-based approach to avoid being misused for tax fraud, tax evasion, tax avoidance, aggressive tax planning, money laundering or financing of terrorism purposes. In addition to the standard due diligence process performed on operations (which includes, inter alia, identification of beneficial owners, integrity assessments to identify any sanctioned individuals or entities, screening for adverse media, presence of Politically Exposed Persons and potential conflict of interests), the EIB carries out an enhanced due diligence on every operation with higher risk factors identified, such as a potential link to a Non-Compliant Jurisdiction (NCJ)5, tax risk indicators and operations with complex multi-jurisdictional structures irrespective of the existence of NCJ links.\n",
      "Having regard to the above mentioned developments, the EIB Group has reviewed and further enhanced its due diligence processes with the aim that the risk-based tax assessment identifies potential tax avoidance concerns targeted by the OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting action plan (BEPS) and EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Package (ATAP). This addresses considerations raised by EIB stakeholders, including the EIB Board of Directors, European Commission, European Parliament and Civil Society Organisations.\n",
      "  \n",
      "The EIB Group closely follows international developments on tax transparency, tax good governance and anti-money laundering/financing of terrorism and proactively engages in dialogue with other International Financial Institutions as well as Civil Society Organisations to maintain its leading position by setting ambitious policies and procedures taking account of best standards and practices.\n",

Building on its financial merits, the EIB is able to borrow at attractive rates, while the benefits of the EIB’s borrowing conditions are passed on to project promoters.

      "Forestry is at the heart of our efforts to support sustainable landscapes, foster rural economic growth and employment, and strengthen the availability of a range of key renewable resources.\n",
      "EU forests cover 155 million ha and wooded land covers 21 million ha, together accounting for more than 42% of EU land area. Forestry contributes to a range of EU policies, including rural development, renewable energy, development cooperation, biodiversity protection and climate change mitigation. Moreover, forests play an important role in maintaining soil health, reducing soil erosion and mitigating flood risks. They are also important carbon sinks, sequestering additional carbon as they grow.\n",
      "Our activities support the full forest value chain including afforestation, reforestation, forest rehabilitation and protection, wood processing, timberland funds, and REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation). We support the EU Forestry Strategy and the EU Forest Action Plan, which frame EU forestry policy, and the Timber Regulation and Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade Initiative for tackling illegal logging and improving traceability. We are not involved in converting natural forest to plantation or commercial logging in primary tropical and subtropical forests.\n",
      "The Sitka spruce is one of the largest species of evergreens in the world. It can grow to nearly 100 meters tall, at an astonishing pace of 1.5 meters per year, and have a trunk diameter of 5 meters. The largest one currently known has an estimated trunk volume of 337 cubic meters – surely enough to produce more than enough paper to print all the copies of Ulysses sold during James Joyce’s lifetime just from a single tree.\n",
      "Every year, some 13 million hectares of forest are lost worldwide. The land use sectors are responsible for about 30% of all greenhouse gas emissions. Most of that is because of the loss and degradation of forests.\n",
      "We have a wide range of products to support public and private investments offering flexibility, expertise and creativity to get projects off the ground\n",

      "The EIB decided to set up a Public Register of environmental documents to enhance the transparency of its operations. In accordance with Regulation (EC) N°1367/2006 (the Aarhus Regulation) Community institutions and bodies shall organise the environmental information which is relevant to their function and which is held by them, with a view to its active and systematic dissemination to the public.\n",
      "They are complementary. If you are looking for general information and documents on the EIB’s main activities, you should first consult the other parts of the website, which extensively inform the public about our activities. The public register, on the other hand, is a specific transparency tool which focuses on the environmental and social documents held by the Bank.\n",
      "The Public Register currently includes the key project-related environmental and social documents held by the Bank, namely:\n",
      "Since December 2016, the Public Register also contains some of the EIB’s key environmental policy documents, strategies and guidelines, such as the EIB Environmental and Social Handbook, the Carbon Footprint Reports, and the EIB Climate Strategy. These will be added as and when they become available (and if deemed applicable).\n",
      "No. The public register strikes a balance between its transparency objective and the administrative reality of the EIB. The public register currently contains both documents related to the projects financed by the Bank, which constitute the key part of the EIB’s activity, as well as some of the key environmental policy documents, strategies and guidelines produced by the EIB since 2012. Other documents such as brochures, press releases or other documents which might indirectly refer to the environment are already published on the Bank website and can be easily accessed by the public.\n",
      "Regarding the projects financed by the Bank, each project generates its own unique collection of documentation, which can change over time either in format or naming. In certain cases, the Bank might receive documents containing varying levels of environmental information regarding its operations (for example, studies or reports provided by a project promoter or other third party) along with commercially sensitive information. These documents are currently not published on the Register and their public disclosure is handled in line with the provisions of the EIB Group Transparency Policy (see below). The EIB’s resources would not allow us to formally register and provide online access to every single environmental and social document/information that we hold. This would be in contradiction with rules of confidentiality and proportionality, or simply very difficult because of technical constraints. However, we seek to grant the widest possible access to environmental and social information related to our activities. The public register therefore currently contains the main standardised environmental and social documents that it holds regarding its operations.\n",
      "Also note that the public register currently contains documents related to projects financed by the Bank from 2012 onwards and does not apply retroactively. However, the fairly detailed information that we provide in relation to this public register, as well as in our “Guide to accessing environmental and social information/documents held by the EIB”, provides a good insight into the type of environmental and social documents which we hold.\n",
      "Yes. The EIB is progressively developing the register and its content and technical features will continue to develop in the future.\n",
      "The EIB welcomes comments and suggestions from all stakeholders as to how to further improve the Public Register.\n",
      "You may consider to submit an application for access to documents in line with the EIB Group Transparency Policy. Application for access to documents can be sent to the EIB Infodesk. Alternatively, the EIB can be contacted through its external offices. Queries regarding details of a specific project, in particular when it is under appraisal by the EIB, should preferably be addressed directly to project promoters. The Bank does not object to project promoters, borrowers, or other competent parties making information available on their relationship and arrangements with the EIB.\n",

      "Digital economy is a key ingredient for stimulating technological innovation and services, and Internet-based applications and technologies will continue to be an essential driver of productivity growth. Investing in digital economy is necessary to support Europe’s growing data traffic and  is also one of the main goals of the EU’s Digital Agenda. Increasingly, every business is a digital business. So high-speed internet, mobile networks and cloud computing are priority areas for the Bank.\n",
      "Digital economy is related to various areas in the development of ICT infrastructures, equipment, services and applications across industries. Our financing to projects in the area of ICT and e-economy can be found in the following areas:\n",
      "Mobile networks\n",
      " Mobile networks include the development of high speed broadband 3G (UMTS) and 4G (LTE) access networks.\n",
      "Fixed broadband access networks\n",
      " Fixed broadband networks entail the development of fixed network infrastructure in terms of cable and fibre to home / building / cabinet (FTTH/B/C) networks.\n",
      "Transmission networks\n",
      " Transmission networks enable national or international connectivity through high capacity fibre optic cables or satellites. Outside the EU, these projects typically entail supporting the development of submarine cables, providing developing countries with international connectivity and therefore enabling broader availability and better quality Internet services. The transmission networks also include broadcasting the recent switchover to digital terrestrial TV (DTV).\n",
      "ICT application and services\n",
      " This area entails the support of ICT application across industries such as automotive, electricity and healthcare. In turn, ICT services  include supporting the development of various, typically public sector services such as e-government, e-health and e-business enabled by ICT infrastructures. It therefore also includes investments in datacenter facilities and associated hosted services such as cloud.\n",
      "RDI in ICT infrastructure, equipment and in semiconductor industry\n",
      " We are also involved in supporting research and development across the ICT domain. This also includes investments in the manufacturing of handsets, network equipment, software, audio-visual equipment, displays (e.g. LCD) and chip manufacturing (nano-microelectronics). Also, RDI activities include the research and development of broadband infrastructures, such as next generation networks and satellites.\n",
      "At the EIB we are working to support the Digital Agenda by providing finance and technical expertise for projects which further these ambitions. Increasingly, every business is a digital business so broadband networks, software development and telecom services are priority areas for the Bank.\n",
      "The broadband company enet is seeking opportunities to link Ireland’s small rural businesses to the internet, allowing them to remain competitive and become a source of growth for rural communities. We backed the innovative young company with a EUR 12 million loan to support their development and ambitious projects.\n",
      "We signed a EUR 110 million loan to support the development of new wireless hearing devices and research into more effective acoustic implants by global leader William Demant. The loan will help the company to strengthen the development of innovative low power radio technology solutions and improve the quality of life for millions of hard of hearing people.\n",
      "Innovative businesses often require innovative financing solutions to support their development. We have a wide range of products to support public and private investments, offering flexibility, expertise and creativity to get projects off the ground\n",

      "The EIB group, as the largest financier of climate change mitigation and adaptation, is committed to Climate Action and protecting the environment. Our commitment to measure and manage our internal footprint is consistent with the environmental and social policies, principles and standards we require of the projects that we finance, and the responsibilities of the various parties. In respect of our internal operations, we aim to lead by example by measuring, managing and reporting the environmental performance of our own internal operations with the same vigour as our financial operations. This means “Walking the Talk”.\n",
      "In 2016 our GHG emissions resulting from our own internal operations reduced by 48% to 6.16 tCO2e per employee from when we first started measuring in 2007.\n",
      "Although absolute emissions have increased since 2007, this is primarily attributable to business volumes and a 119% growth in staff numbers, resulting in correlated increases across business travel and buildings-related emissions and the fact that we now include more within the scope of the internal footprint.\n",
      "We first calculated the carbon footprint of our head office operations in Luxembourg in 2007, setting a target to reduce relative emissions by 20-30% by 2020. Through understanding our GHG emissions, we can identify and implement measures to reduce and to track performance. \n",
      "We have taken various measures to reduce our own GHG emissions such as optimising heating and ventilation systems, active lighting management systems, virtualisation and consolidation of our IT infrastructure, implementation of “follow me” print systems and many others. We have further implemented changes to our travel policy to address the largest component of our Scope 3 emissions, business travel as well as implementation more practical solutions such as, video conferencing, Internet (Voice over IP) communications platform to enable virtual meetings that further avoid the need for travel.\n",
      "We started compensating our residual emissions in 2013 through the world’s first project to be validated and verified under the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS)  and the Climate, Community and Biodiversity Standard (CCB), the Wildlife Work REDD+ project in the Kasigau corridor in Kenya. In addition to the GHG benefits from the protection of natural carbon sinks, a number of local community based, sustainable development initiatives have also resulted from the proceeds of the project.\n",

      "The initiative allows the promoters of investment projects co-financed by the three development institutions in EU partner countries to benefit from a larger project finance capacity through a structured division of labour.\n",
      "The EIB, KfW and AFD are all significant players in European external action, but they work under different regulations, statutes and legal and governance structures.\n",
      "Under this initiative, most of the tasks during the project cycle are given to one of the three institutions as a lead financier, from appraisal to preparing lending decisions and implementation. The lead financier is appointed because they will have particular expertise in a given economic sector, or a significant presence in the project country. Close cooperation between the lead and the two co-financiers is integral in maximising the full benefits.\n",
      "We have successfully completed an MRI pilot phase, which involved co-financing 14 projects in Sub-Saharan Africa, North Africa and the Middle East.\n",
      "We were able to test the scope for reliance and delegation which led to the formalisation of the MRI “Operational Guidelines”, a detailed, binding framework which allows financing operations to be handled in a way that satisfies the requirements of all three partners.\n",
      "The Operational Guidelines were signed on 21 January 2013, and the MRI roll-out phase has started. This is open to more regions, including Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe as we seek to increase the impact of EU external policies on economic growth, employment, poverty alleviation, climate action, and regional integration, and improve the efficiency and visibility of those policies.\n",

      "The EIB finances projects in most sectors. To be eligible projects must contribute to EU economic policy objectives. For further information please see the Priorities pages.\n",
      "No special formalities are involved for the submission of applications to the EIB for individual loans. Project promoters are required simply to provide the Bank's Operations Directorate with a detailed description of their capital investment together with the prospective financing arrangements. For further details of required documentation: Application Documents.\n",
      "Initial contacts to discuss a proposed project can be in any form, by telephone, fax, e-mail or letter. The project promoter should provide sufficient information to allow the EIB to assess whether the project adheres to EIB lending objectives and has a well-developed business plan.\n",
      "For projects where the total cost is under EUR 25 million, the EIB provides intermediated loans (credit lines) to local, regional and national banks.\n",
      "The lending decision for EIB loans via credit lines remains with the financial intermediary. Promoters interested in EIB financing for projects under EUR 25 million should contact the banks and other intermediaries involved directly with a detailed description of their capital investment together with the prospective financing arrangements.\n",
      "The EIB also provides direct loans for midcap companies (with up to 3000 employees) where the loan volume requested is between EUR 7.5m and EUR 25m.\n",
      "Potential promoters should ensure that their project adheres to these conditions. Further information can be found at:\n",

      "Its objective is to stimulate capital market financing for large-scale infrastructure projects in the sectors of transport (TEN-T), energy (TEN-E) and information and communication technology (ICT). According to the Commission, the European Union’s infrastructure investment needs to meet the Europe 2020 objectives in these sectors could reach as much as EUR 2 trillion.\n",
      "The Project Bond initiative is designed to enable eligible infrastructure projects promoters, usually public private partnerships (PPP), to attract additional private finance from institutional investors such as insurance companies and pension funds.\n",
      "This will be achieved by providing credit enhancement to those promoters, whose debt will effectively be divided into two tranches: senior and subordinated.\n",
      "The subordinated debt, or Project Bond Credit Enhancement (PBCE) can take the form of a loan from the Bank, with the support of the European Commission and is given to the promoter at the outset. It may also take the form of a contingent credit line which can be drawn upon if the revenues generated by the project are not sufficient to ensure senior debt service.\n",
      "The PBCE underlies the senior debt and therefore improves its credit quality, offering peace of mind to institutional investors.\n",
      "The bonds themselves will be issued by the promoters not by the Bank or the Member State in question. The support will be available during the lifetime of the project, including the construction phase.\n",
      "According to the European Commission, the European Union’s infrastructure investment needs to meet the Europe 2020 objectives could reach as much as EUR 2 trillion in the sectors of transport (TEN-T), energy (TEN-E) and information and communication technology (ICT).\n",
      "In his “State of the Union” speech in 2010, EC President J.M. Barroso proposed the “Europe 2020 Project Bond Initiative” to mobilise the necessary funding for project financing of infrastructure: “An EU initiative to support project bonds, together with the EIB, would help address the needs for investment in large EU infrastructure projects”.\n",
      "The legal base of the Europe 2020 Project Bond Initiative was adopted in the summer of 2012 by the European Parliament and the ECOFIN Council and the instrument base was signed between the European Commission and European Investment Bank in November 2012.\n",
      "The objective of the cooperation with the European Investment Bank is to build on existing experience with joint EU-EIB Group instruments and to utilise the EIB’s expertise in EU infrastructure financing.\n",
      "Project bonds are one of the financial instruments foreseen under the proposed “Connecting Europe Facility” (CEF), which is part of the wider “Europe 2020” strategy. The aim of the CEF is to provide a longer-term financial framework ensuring that energy, transport and telecommunications projects are developed and implemented in a timely and effective manner.\n",
      "The main objective of the initiative is to create the conditions to attract additional private sector financing for individual infrastructure projects.\n",
      "There is therefore a need to find new ways to promote private sector financing of infrastructure projects without increasing direct public funding and therefore public indebtedness.\n",
      "The Europe 2020 Project Bond instrument is designed to provide an alternative to financing projects through bank loans or public sector grants in order to close the infrastructure financing gap. If a project can be appropriately structured, grants and project bonds could potentially be combined.\n",
      "Targeted investors are institutional investors such as pension funds and insurance companies, i.e. investors with long-term liability structures and regulated rating requirements for their investments. For these investors, project bonds represent a natural match for their long-term obligations.\n",
      "Besides having access to a new asset class providing diversification and a solid rating, investors will also be interested in project bonds because of the EIB’s expertise and track record in infrastructure and PPP financing.\n",
      "The mechanism of improving the credit standing of projects relies on the capacity to separate the debt of the project company into tranches: a senior and a subordinated tranche. The provision of the subordinated tranche increases the credit quality of the senior tranche to a level where most institutional investors are comfortable holding the bond for a long period.\n",
      "The subordinated tranche – namely the Project Bond Credit Enhancement (PBCE), provided by the EIB with EC support – can take the form of a loan, which is given to the project company from the outset, or a contingent credit line which can be drawn upon if the revenues generated by the project are not sufficient to ensure senior debt service.\n",
      "In terms of projects targeted, the PBI is looking at those fulfilling defined sectoral eligibility criteria: trans-European networks in the fields of transport and energy, as well as broadband and ICT projects.\n",
      "Based on market demand and opportunities, the EIB has identified and is working on projects that present reasonable prospects of successful closing within the pilot phase - and will engage in its usual due diligence process.\n",
      "As certain projects currently under planning with national authorities will not be ready during the pilot phase, the EIB is also prepared to engage in up-stream project preparation work together with tendering authorities in order to position capital market solutions more generally for projects taking place in the period 2014-2020. Projects are subject to standard EIB appraisal requirements - and coverage under the EU-EIB Project Bond initiative will be subject to the relevant eligibility criteria and available budgetary commitments\n",
      "Market and project opportunities are important factors when it comes to the geographical spread of the initial transactions. The first pilot projects will most likely be situated in one of the EU’s more advanced PPP/project finance markets, but the objective is to have standardised products enabling the Europe 2020 project bonds to fund projects throughout the Union and the EIB is looking to have as much diversification as possible of projects within the pilot phase.\n",
      "In July 2012, the European Parliament and the ECOFIN Council approved the legislative proposal issued by the Commission in October 2011. The Cooperation Agreement between the EIB and the European Commission, defining the mechanism for risk and revenue sharing between the two institutions, was signed on November 6, 2012. Suitable projects will need to reach financial close between now and end of 2016, provided that the EIB obtains financing approval by its Board before the end of 2014.\n",
      "By the end of June 2013, the EIB Board of Directors has already approved nine TEN-T and TEN-E projects in six different Member States as being eligible under the Project Bond Initiative. It includes motorway projects in SK, DE, BE and UK, grid connections to offshore wind farms in DE and UK and gas storage facilities in ES and IT. The first financial closures of these projects are expected in the second half of 2013.\n",
      "The scope of the pilot phase is to test the project bond concept during the remaining period of the current multi-annual financial framework 2007-2013, before the next multi-annual financial framework 2014-2020 and the implementation of the CEF (Connecting Europe Facility). This testing phase will be funded by means of re-deployment of unused EUR 230 million of EU budgetary resources from budget lines for existing programmes. The sectoral split is as follows: EUR 200 million and EUR 10 million is being dedicated to trans-European networks in the fields of transport and energy respectively; EUR 20 million to financing high-speed broadband projects. The budget of EUR 230 million should enable the EIB to provide financing to infrastructure projects worth more than EUR 4 billion across the three sectors.\n",
      "Additional funding for the Project Bond Initiative (PBI) under the “Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) in the 2014-20 period would allow a further development of the initiative depending on budgetary allocations.\n",
      "While the European Commission’s role is to define sector eligibility criteria and provide the EIB with the capital contribution required to enable the Bank to credit enhance project bonds, the EIB will:\n",
      "Although the EIB will not be acting as a controlling creditor, a decision matrix governing project decision making is currently being developed and will need to be agreed on a project by project basis by the parties.\n",
      "This document is to provide a general outline of how it is currently contemplated that the Project Bond Initiative and Project Bonds Credit Enhancement (PBCE) will work.\n",

      "Norway is the EIB’s largest EFTA partner in terms of finance, and accounts for almost half of EFTA lending. The country supplies some 20% of the EU’s total gas requirements and is a pioneer in renewable energies. Similarly, Iceland also has abundant natural resources and is itself a pioneer in geothermal energy production. Both of the northern nations further stand out for fish production, metals and maritime transport\n",

Switzerland is not only a financial centre, but also plays host to multinationals and major companies in the fields of biotechnology, scientific research and machinery. Liechtenstein is small but specialises in capital-intensive high technology products and research and development.\n",

The Metro will increase use of public transport in Lucknow from 10 to 27%. This infrastructure project will make a vital contribution toward the city’s development and represents an important step in the battle against climate change.\n",
      "Building sustainable infrastructure also touches on innovation. The EIB last year signed a EUR 20 million loan to build high-speed internet access in Angola, and we are appraising a potential EUR 40 million loan to roll out a mobile telecommunications network in Mali.\n",

      "No, the possession of a work permit in the EU is not sufficient by itself to be eligible for an EIB post.\n",
      "There is not a quota system on the nationalities of staff. Nonetheless, the Bank’s Statutes (art. 11.7) require staff selection processes to consider, not only personal ability and qualifications, but also the attainment of an equitable representation of the nationals of the Bank’s Member States. This may mean that in cases where competence levels of candidates are comparable, preference may be given to candidates of under-represented nationalities.\n",
      "The two official working languages at the European Investment Bank are English and French. Excellent knowledge of written and spoken English and/or French and good command of the other language are required. In practice, however, numerous languages are spoken in the day-to-day work, therefore knowledge of other EU languages would be an advantage. The EIB provides access to language training for staff.\n",
      "The Bank offers employment contracts which may be of temporary or indefinite duration, depending on the nature of the post.\n",

Application forms or CVs sent by post, fax or e-mail will not be accepted.\n",

Upon submitting the on-line application, candidates certify that the statements made thereon are complete and true. Any willful misstatement may lead to disqualification from employment or disciplinary action in accordance with the policies of the EIB group.\n",

These are then used to support economically viable projects which promote EU policy objectives.\n",
      "FIs aim to put EU funds to good and efficient use, ensuring that grants are complemented by other financial products so that EU funding can be used time and time again in a revolving fashion. FIs can be combined with technical support or guarantee/interest rate subsidies.\n",
      "The EU Member States who receive funding under the ESIF have a national body known as the Managing Authority (MA) which oversees the use of the available resources. MAs use ESIF allocations and place them in FIs through a Fund of Funds or a financial intermediary from which eligible projects can be financed.\n",
      "FIs help mobilise additional public-private co-investments and provide a variety of incentives to better project performance. They have been used for financing Structural Funds investments since the 1994-1999 Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF). Their importance increased during 2007-2013 and they now represent around 5 % of total European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) resources. They are expected to play an even stronger role in the 2014-2020 programming period. The main benefits of FIs can be summarised as follows:\n",

      "As the EU bank, the EIB is committed to working together with partners to help define and deliver an effective response to the global forced displacement crisis and further strengthen economic development contributions. This is being achieved by:\n",
      "At the request of the European Council, we are developing a specific initiative to support economic resilience in the EU’s Southern Neighbourhood and the Western Balkans regions, both of which have been significantly impacted by the refugee crisis on the EU’s doorstep. \n",
      "The influx of refugees into European Union over the past year presents one of the greatest challenges ever faced by the European Union. Political instability and conflict in the EU’s neighbouring countries are driving this mass movement of people. The need for action with immediate impact is clear.\n",
      "While the solution to the root causes of the crisis will ultimately be found around the negotiating table, there is in the meantime a role and a responsibility for those of us committed to furthering peace and prosperity in Europe and its neighbourhood to confront the challenges. The current refugee crisis is a reminder of the interconnectedness of development issues, not only with geopolitics, but also with growth and investment policies in every country.\n",
      "As the EU’s bank and the largest IFI lender for projects in the pre-accession and MENA regions, the EIB is committed to assisting EU Member States in addressing the refugee crisis in host countries, transit countries and countries of origin. Our experience of more than three decades in the region means we are best placed to deliver financing as part of the EU response.\n",

      "Which projects are included on the list?\n",
      " In accordance with the EIB's transparency policy, the list includes all public sector projects, those for which a call for tenders has been announced in the Official Journal and all private sector projects, with the exception of those for which the promoter has presented legitimate confidentiality reasons. The list is updated as individual projects are identified and appraised.\n",
      "At what stage of the project cycle do projects appear in the list?\n",
      " Projects are introduced before the EIB Board of Director's examination, the precise timing (date of entry) depending on the progress of the appraisal (\"Under Examination\" status).\n",
      "Which projects are not included in the list?\n",
      " All projects are included in the list unless the project promoter (or other business partners where appropriate) oppose inclusion on justified grounds of commercial/market confidentiality.\n",
      "What type of information will not be disclosed?\n",
      " At the request of the project promoter, certain information may be excluded, for instance contract details. In addition, the Bank will not disclose financial data on promoters, borrowers, and co-financing institutions, as well as its own internal analysis and comments on such data, industrial processes and market information.\n",
      "At what point is a project approved?\n",
      " The inclusion of a project on the list does not commit the Bank to financing it. Approval by the Board of Directors (\"Approved\" status) translates into a loan only with the signature of a finance contract, which includes the technical description of the investment financed. Disbursements follow contract signature, according to the needs of project implementation and subject to fulfilment of all relevant pre-disbursement conditions. After signature (\"Signed\" status), the project remains on the list of projects under consideration for a further six months. It is also placed on the list of projects financed.\n",
      "Is the data on the project list subject to change?\n",
      " Before financing approval by the Board of Directors, and before loan signature, projects are under appraisal and negotiation, and therefore data provided on the project list is indicative. For instance, the reference to EIB finance and the total cost of a project are for expected amounts. Only information on the location, sector and status of the project are automatically updated at the different stages.\n",

      "The promotion of sustainable, competitive and secure sources of energy is a key EU policy objective and an important sector for EIB financing. The EIB applies strict energy lending criteria established on the basis of a comprehensive review to ensure that our lending in the energy sector reflects EU energy and climate policy, as well as current investment trends. As a result of the review, our energy lending focuses on energy efficiency, renewable energy, energy networks, as well as related research and innovation. In the transition to a low-carbon global economy, we also introduced an Emissions Performance Standard which is applied to all fossil fuel generation projects to screen out investments whose carbon emissions exceed a threshold level which reflects existing EU and national commitments to limit carbon emissions.\n",
      "In 2017, our loans helped to construct 76 557 km of power lines and generate 10 924 MW of electricity, out of which 99.6% from renewables.\n",
      "We support the development and expansion of renewable energy projects to make Europe’s energy supplies more sustainable, competitive and secure.\n",
      "By investing in renewable energy we support the European Union’s climate policy and will help to achieve our target of 20% of overall EU energy consumption being met from renewable energy sources by 2020. We not only finance mature renewable energy technologies, such as onshore wind farms, hydropower, geothermal and solid biomass, but also strongly encourage the expansion of early-stage or evolving technologies such as solar, offshore wind, photovoltaic, concentrated solar power and second-generation biofuels. We require the best available technology to be used in all the projects we finance.\n",
      "Increased energy efficiency lowers costs and improves competitiveness in the production of goods and delivery of services. Investments in energy efficiency also have the potential to create significant numbers of jobs.\n",
      "Our financing of such projects supports the EU’s goal of increasing energy efficiency in the Union by 20% by the year 2020 so as to reduce energy consumption. Projects typically include retrofitting and expansion of existing social and urban infrastructure and services. This involves district heating and cooling, cogeneration, rehabilitation and modernisation of buildings and improvement of industrial processes, as well as improving and upgrading the energy values of urban transport, waste and water management networks.\n",
      "We streamline energy efficiency considerations across the whole range of our lending activities. We apply the highest EU standards with regard to cogeneration and the energy performance of buildings and, in most cases, we ask for energy audits to be undertaken in order to assess whether investments are in line with these standards.\n",
      "Solar energy isn’t just about light or mobile phones. It irrigates and fertilises farms, benefitting the 791 million Africans who have no electricity.\n",

      "Loans – the main source of our backing for energy projects. We also offer structured financing options.\n",
      "Investment – We and our partners have raised billions of euros for climate investment through funds of funds such as the Global Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Fund, European Energy Efficiency Fund and vehicles such as the Marguerite Fund, the Crescent Clean Energy Fund, the Facility for Energy Sustainability and Security of Supply and the Green Initiative and the Climate Awareness Bond.\n",

      "Following a call from the European Council, the European Investment Bank is rolling-out the Economic Resilience Initiative. The initiative aims at rapidly mobilising additional financing in support of the capacity of economies in the Southern Neighbourhood and Western Balkans regions to absorb and respond to crises and shocks, such as the Syrian refugee crisis, while maintaining strong growth. Boosting economic resilience in these regions by investing in  vital infrastructure, developing the private sector and stimulating growth and job creation also contributes to addressing root causes of migration.\n",
      "The Economic Resilience Initiative forms part of the joined up EU response to the challenges posed by forced displacement and migration, and will be implemented in close cooperation with EU member states, the European Commission and other partners.\n",
      "Italy, Luxembourg, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia have become the first EU Member States to pledge contributions for the Economic Resilience Initiative.\n",
      "To make this initiative a reality, the EIB is building on over three decades of experience supporting investment projects in the region. Given the urgency and importance for the EU, the EIB has moved ahead and already started stepping up its support to the two regions as part of its own commitment to the Economic Resilience Initiative.\n",
      "Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Kosovo*, Montenegro and Serbia\n",
      "Examples of EIB-supported projects that are already making a difference for the people in the Southern Neighbourhood and Western Balkans:\n",
      "Jordan, Israel and Palestine are some of the world's driest countries and lack sufficient fresh water for their population. Meanwhile, the diversion of much of the water that feeds the Dead Sea has caused the biblical lake to shrink. But Zoubi is project director of an ambitious venture now gathering momentum that aims to use the waters of the Red Sea to alleviate the shortage across the region and to revitalize the Dead Sea.\n",
      "For 20 years, the Microfund for Women has provided financing to women across Jordan and helped boost their confidence to engage in business. The first EIB microfinance operation in Jordan, underpinned by EU funding, is helping low-income entrepreneurs with small loans and technical assistance.\n",
      "Combining EIB expertise, venture capital and EU grants, Silicon Badia provides expertise and capital to empower young and female entrepreneurs in the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean region. Amina Al Ramadna is one of them. \"When you go to a normal bank they ask for approval from your husband. Here, they looked at the business as a whole,” she explains.\n",
      "Syrian refugee children in Lebanon study a Cloud-based version of the Lebanese curriculum on $60-tablets. An online education company financed by the EIB is making it happen. Investments like this help Syrian children, whose lives have been disrupted by war, to catch up with some of the studies they may have missed—and also support innovation and job-creating new companies.\n",
      "A EUR 200 million EIB loan is helping modernise four major clinical centres in Belgrade, Novi Sad, Nis and Kragujevac. The project includes the design, construction, equipping and implementation of new buildings as well as the rehabilitation of existing facilities. Once completed, the upgraded clinical centres will provide high quality healthcare services to the local population. In 2003, the EIB also supported emergency modernisations in other 20 regional hospitals across the country.\n",
      "The Economic Resilience Initiative involves a step change in EIB support for the two regions by increasing its financing by EUR 6 billion over a five year period starting from October 2016, in addition to the EUR 7.5 billion of EIB financing already projected for the Southern Neighbourhood and the Western Balkans during this period. The support is expected to translate into substantial impact on the ground and reinforces economic resilience.\n",
      "The EIB estimates the EUR 6 billion, together with other sources of public and private sector finance, will deliver EUR 15 billion euros of additional investment in the eligible countries of the Southern Neighbourhood and the Western Balkans by 2020.\n",
      "The initiative also allows the EU Bank to provide additional technical assistance and advisory services to support the projects.\n",
      "ERI investment is progressing: Since its launch in late 2016, the EIB approved 13 projects representing financing of some EUR 1 billion. Well over half of that went into private sector development. Lending through partner banks alone is set to benefit over 600 smaller businesses and midcaps, helping to sustain more than 40 000 jobs.\n",
      "Other projects include urgently-needed investments in water and waste, but also vital transport, energy and healthcare infrastructure. The operations cover Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, Palestine, Serbia, Montenegro as well as Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n",
      "Over two million refugees are currently hosted in the Southern Neighbourhood, while the Western Balkans have acted as one of the main migratory routes to Europe. The initiative from the EU bank, part of a joined up EU effort, will help to tackle the root causes of migration and contribute to sustainable development by supporting projects with high social and environmental returns. In line with the Bank’s existing activities, investments will strive to generate employment opportunities for young people and women, and support climate action.\n",
      "In practice, developing economic resilience in host and transit countries means creating jobs and building the infrastructure needed for the local population as well as displaced population. Refugee communities may also benefit, providing them with opportunities to build their self-reliance and live in dignity.\n",
      "Furthermore, the investments in economic resilience will contribute to improve the preparedness of the regions for future external shocks, and ideally also contribute to enhanced stability in fragile countries.\n",
      "The European Union’s External Investment Plan, agreed in mid-2017, is a new approach to the way the EU supports sustainable development and aims to identify, prepare and deliver support for investment projects in Africa and EU Neighbourhood countries.\n",
      "The Economic Resilience Initiative by the EIB is complementary to the EU External Investment Plan. Ensuring close coordination and complementary with EU initiatives is a key priority. In fact, given the EIB's important role in the EIP, we can ensure the two work hand-in-hand. ERI is part of Europe's joined up response to the migration and refugee crisis, with a focus on tackling the longer-term causes of migration. The EIB will continue to use the blending support offered through the EIP and will be one of the implementing partners for the new EU guarantee offered through the European Fund for Sustainable Development (EFSD).\n",
      "The EIB will provide a total of EUR 5.7 billion of own-resources financing to the Economic Resilience Initiative, but in order to implement the plan to its full extent, the EIB would need:\n",
      "In order to address the common challenges that the EU neighbourhood is facing and to provide the concessional finance needed to implement the ambitious investments included in the Economic Resilience Initiative project pipeline, the EIB is partnering with the international donor community. Funds will be held in a dedicated fund, specifically the Economic Resilience Initiative Fund (ERIF).\n",
      "By contributing to the ERIF, donors can make a direct impact on the lives of migrants and members of the local population in host and transit countries of the Southern Neighbourhood and Western Balkan regions.\n",
      "We are on track, five pledged contributions from Italy, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia and Luxembourg mean that we can now launch the ERI Fund and accelerate high-impact investments aimed at creating new opportunities and building economic resilience in the regions. They will help to improve people’s daily life and the business environment not only in communities where many migrants come from, but also in host and transit communities. The Economic Resilience Initiative was requested by all 28 member states of the European Union. With these five countries leading the way, others are expected to follow soon.\n",
      "This is in addition to the financing already available, including a EUR 90 million contribution from the EIB itself for technical assistance on getting projects off the ground.\n",
      "\"When people can look forward to a dignified and peaceful life in their own countries and are protected from conflicts and natural disasters, they have every incentive to build their future where they really feel at home.\"\n",
      "Werner Hoyer, EIB President.\n",
      "At a special conference at the European Parliament in Brussels on 21 June 2017, EIB Vice-President Dario Scannapieco laid out the actions that the EU bank is taking to help manage migration to Europe and to tackle its root causes in Europe’s neighbourhood and beyond.\n",
      "Speaking at the UN Summit for Refugees and Migrants in October 2016, EIB President Werner Hoyer called for new partnerships to tackle the challenges posed by migration and forced displacement and laid out the EIB’s Economic Resilience Initiative.\n",

      "Our role extends beyond financing, as we help businesses to operate and grow transparently in an environmentally and socially responsible manner. We do so by investing time, capacity and resources in further understanding how their business and industry – and thus our financing – affect the welfare of local people and the surrounding environment.\n",
      "We encourage the growth of responsible businesses because they can enable and catalyze social and economic change. In the long-run sustainable businesses provide higher-level jobs, income, and tax generation to strengthen local society. We believe that these elements are key to reducing poverty and inequality.

      "The bank is the first Argentinian lender to get FMO’s backing. It is expected to use the loan to improve its balance sheet as well as assist the working capital needs of micro and small-to-medium sized enterprises (MSMEs). Its partner firms will also receive long-term financing in both US dollars and local currency. Around half of the facilities are denominated in Argentine pesos.\n",
      "Pablo Pochat, the financial director for the bank, told Development Finance: “For some time, Comafi has focused on the SME segment, to which we assign an increasingly relevant role in the economic growth of Argentina, and for which our institution has developed significant comparative advantages, such as personalised attention, proximity and specific credit lines, this financing will be applied precisely to strengthen and promote this business strategy.”\n",
      "After winning midterm elections in October last year, the ruling party of Argentina, led by President Mauricio Macri, aims to roll out a tax bill that could lift the financial burden on corporates and bring the tax code closer to international standards. In the third quarter of 2017, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) revised its growth forecast for the country up to 2.9 percent. The organisation cited structural reforms on tax among the reasons for its revision.\n",
      "The World Bank states that as recently as 2016, domestic credit to the private sector was only 14 percent of gross domestic product in Argentina, one of the lowest proportions of any economy in Latin America. According to the GPS of Argentinian Enterprises, a digital data platform run by Argentina’s ministry of production, of more than 600,000 active companies in the country, 99 percent are micro and small-to-medium sized enterprises. These firms generate around four million jobs for people in the transport sector as well as commerce, food, hospitality and gastronomy.\n",
      "Huib-Jan de Ruijter, director of financial institutions of the FMO, called Argentina “a country that requires a significant increase in private investment”, adding: “This loan will allow Banco Comafi to continue growing in the SME segment and provide much needed long-term finance for its clients, thereby supporting job creation and economic and social development.”\n",
      "Pochat said: “It strengthens our financial structure and supports our strategy of accompanying the growth of our customers in the MSME segment.”\n",

      "To maximise our impact, we invest in sectors that are important for facilitating business growth, job creation and poverty reduction:\n",
      "Access to electricity is critical for economic growth, job creation and social development. Norfund contributes to improving access to reliable energy by investing in electricity generation projects where the need for capital is large. Clean energy is Norfund’s largest business area and constitutes about half of the portfolio.\n",
      "A well-functioning financial system facilitates economic growth and reduces poverty. Providing access to capital via financial institutions, microfinance and SME funds is therefore the second of Norfund’s priority sectors.  \n",
      "Norfund has selected agriculture as its third priority sector. The sector employs approximately half of Africa’s workforce and plays an important role in its economy and development. Agricultural growth can drive overall economic growth and transformation, and has proven to be effective in reducing poverty in low-income countries. \n",
      "Enterprises in these sectors provide employment opportunities, pay taxes and supply goods and services. We collect data on key development effects from all investees each year in order to monitor these effects. This reporting is aligned with the best-practice approach developed by the IFI Working Group on Indicator Harmonisation\n",

      "Norfund contributes to increasing access to capital for SMEs and unbanked individuals by investing in financial institutions.  \n",
      "Banks and microfinance institutions depend on equity and debt in order to extend loans to their customers. These financial service providers need capital to develop products and increase their market reach. They also need to make costly but crucial capital investments, for example in IT systems.\n",
      "Norfund invests primarily in commercial banks and microfinance institutions, but also in non-bank financial institutions like leasing, housing finance and factoring. Our focus is particularly to support institutions and business models that target SMEs and mass market financial inclusion.\n",
      "Norfund offers long-term financing and gives priority to equity investments. However, we may also provide senior or subordinated debt depending on the type of institution, geography and its financing needs.\n",
      "Norfund’s target investments include locally-owned medium-sized and large bank institutions that are focused on serving SMEs, the retail market, and clients who have not previously had access to financial services. The banking sector in poor countries is often underdeveloped, characterised by a large number of relatively small local banks with high costs, high margins and limited services to SMEs. Therefore, we aim to create efficient, scalable banks that can provide more targeted and less expensive services to SMEs and individuals through a reduction in sector costs and increased capabilities. \n",
      "In Sub-Saharan Africa, Norfund's direct equity investments in banks are primarily targeted through our investment company Arise.\n",
      "Microfinance include financial services offered to low-income individuals and micro-companies that do not otherwise have access to traditional banking services. Microfinance services usually include microcredit, deposits and insurance. Microfinance institutions (MFIs) range in size from small non-profit organisations, cooperatives and self-help groups on one hand, to commercial and state banks, insurance companies and specialised microfinance institutions on the other. Norfund's investments in microfinance are primarily targeted through our investments company, the Nordic Microfinance Initiative (NMI) in Africa and parts of Southeast Asia.\n",
      "Non-Bank Financial Institutions (NBFIs) supplement the services provided by banks and include leasing, factoring, specialized lending and trade finance. Norfund invests in non-bank financial institutions that are dedicated to serving SMEs, such as leasing, factoring and lending institutions. \n",
      "For direct investments, Norfund focuses on projects in South East Asia (including Bangladesh), Central America as well as Sub-Saharan Africa.  \n",

      "Access to reliable electricity is a prerequisite for economic growth and development. The potential power-generating capacity is substantial and remains unexploited in many developing countries.\n",
      "Considerable investments are needed to meet the rising demand for electricity. In Sub-Saharan Africa, lack of access to energy is a major constraint for the establishment and growth of small- and medium-sized businesses. \n",
      "Funding from multilateral development banks and bilateral DFIs is usually crucial, as the credit ratings for clean energy projects in poor countries often are below investment grade, deterring international investors. DFIs also play a role in helping pioneer investments in the energy sector to demonstrate their financial viability and to catalyse further investments from the private sector.\n",
      "Norfund contributes to improving access to reliable electricity by investing in electricity generation where the need for capital is large. Clean energy is Norfund's largest business area and constitutes about half of the portfolio.\n",
      "While hydropower has dominated the energy portfolio until recently, solar and wind energy have become more competitive and account for an increasing portion of the portfolio. \n",
      "Norfund’s strategy is to invest with – or via – industrial partners. The competence we have built up in these long-term partnerships have been essential to Norfund's success.\n",
      "Until recently, hydro power has dominated Norfund's clean energy portfolio. SN Power has been and still is Norfund's key actor and resource in this regard. SN Power's vision is to be a leading hydropower provider in emerging markets, facilitating development and local economic growth through the delivery of clean, renewable energy.  Until September 2017, Statkraft and Norfund owned 50 percent each in SN Power. However, in September 2017 Statkraft and Norfund closed an agreement to swap shares in their jointly owned international hydropower assets.Today, Norfund thereby owns 100% shares in SN Power.\n",
      "Norfund is also prioritising small-scale hydropower and off-grid solutions and has recently established partnerships in both. \n",
      "Solar and wind power have been more competitive and account for an increasing part of Norfund's portfolio. Approximately 250 MWp solar power has been built with Scatec Solar, and further significant growth is expected. \n",
      "The Lake Turkana Wind Power Project (LTWP), in which KLP Norfund Invest has provided 12,5% of the equity required, aims to provide 310MW of reliable, low-cost wind power to the Kenya national grid. This is equivalent to approximately 20% of the current installed electricity generating capacity.\n",
      "Many renewable technologies, such as wind and solar power, have variable production and are dependent on the weather. To stabilise the grid, other reserve and balancing power sources are required. These could be supplied, for example, by natural gas – a domestic resource in many African countries and one which has a low carbon footprint compared to other fossil fuel energy sources.\n",
      "In 2015, Norfund acquired a 30% stake in Globeleq, one of Africa’s leading independent power companies. Globeleq builds power generation plants with solar, wind and gas as key fuel sources. \n",
      "Norfund prioritises investments in countries classified as least developed countries (LDCs) and countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.  92% of Norfund's new clean energy investments in 2015 were made in Africa. Of the total clean energy portfolio, 37% is in Africa.\n",
      "Norfund distinguishes between the concepts \"clean energy\", which is the name of the Norfund investment department and covers the whole energy portfolio, and \"renewable energy\", which only covers energy based on renewable sources. The difference is largely accounted for by investments in gas-fired power plants in East and West Africa. \n"

      "Min jobb er å investere i næringsliv i fattige land for å skape arbeidsplasser og bekjempe fattigdom. Alle er idag enige i at næringslivet har en avgjørende rolle i kampen mot fattigdom. Derfor ønsker vi mer investeringer og større engasjement fra norske bedrifter.\n",
      "At næringslivet opptrer ansvarlig både som arbeidsgiver og som aktør i sine lokalsamfunn er selvsagte krav. Akseptable HMS standarder på arbeidsplassene er grunnleggende. Null toleranse for korrupsjon og barnearbeid en selvfølge. Men i tillegg settes det ofte høye (og urealistiske) krav til at hvert prosjekt skal dekke en rekke andre gode formål. Og toleransen for å gjøre feil er lik null.\n",
      "Spørsmålet jeg reiser er følgende: kan vi i vår iver etter å gjøre det gode stille for høye krav til hvordan næringslivet må opptre?\n",
      "Spørsmålet jeg reiser er følgende: kan vi i vår iver etter å gjøre det gode stille for høye krav til hvordan næringslivet må opptre? Gjøre investeringer i fattige land så krevende eller omdømmekostnadene hvis noe går galt så store, at mange avstår fra å prøve. At det rett og slett blir mindre investeringer og færre nye arbeidsplasser!\n",
      "Statistikk viser at vestlig næringsliv for tiden trekker seg tilbake fra de fattigste landene. Vestlige banker er på vei ut av Afrika sør for Sahara, og direkte utenlandsinvesteringer i enkeltbedrifter (FDI) går ned, særlig i de fattigste landene.\n",
      "Så noe er helt galt. Dette er motsatt av det som det internasjonale samfunnet er enig om at må til for å løse klima og fattigdomsproblemene i verden.\n",
      "I kampen for det gode – menneskerettigheter og miljøhensyn- er det laget mange, til dels konkurrerende og overlappende retningslinjer og krav for bedrifter som skal operere i fattige land. For å nevne noen; FN har vedtatt «Guiding Principles on Human Rights», OECD har vedtatt «Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises» for selskaper med virksomhet i flere land, og Verdensbanken (IFC) har sine flere hundre sider lange «Environmental and Social Performance Standards». I praksis oppleves dette som en jungel som er ugjennomtrengelig for små og mellomstore bedrifter, og som de største bedriftene må ansette egne «diplomater» for å håndtere.\n",
      "Selv om retningslinjer og krav er viktig, er hva som gjøres i praksis på bakken det som er avgjørende.\n",
      "Selv om retningslinjer og krav er viktig, er hva som gjøres i praksis på bakken det som er avgjørende. Vi i Norfund bruker mye tid og krefter på å sikre at bedriftene vi investerer i følger avtalte retningslinjer og opererer ansvarlig i praksis. Problemet oppstår når næringslivskritikere og media mener at det å følge ett sett retningslinjer ikke er nok. Når deres iver etter å oppnå det aller beste, gjør det umulig å få gjort jobben i praksis.\n",
      "Virkeligheten er nemlig at det er genuint vanskelig å operere på bakken i fattige land. Daglig drift krever at man knekker krevende kultur koder. Å beskytte lokalsamfunn som berøres av bedriften er krevende, særlig i land der myndighetene er svake og nasjonale lover i liten grad er implementert. Bedriftene må da også gjøre oppgaver som ellers ville vært myndighetenes ansvar. Utenforstående krav og forventninger gjør jobben enda mer utfordrende.\n",
      "Noen ganger blir terrenget for vanskelig, selv for Norfund. Vi har for eksempel sluttet å gjøre energiprosjekter i områder med urbefolkning i Mellom-Amerika. ILO konvensjonen om urfolks rettigheter har i praksis vist seg å være så lite definert at vi ikke kan finne måter å håndtere konfliktene som oppstår i samfunn uten tillit til stat og myndigheter og med sterke fordelingskonflikter lokalt. Rundt slike prosjekter er konfliktnivået så ukontrollerbart at neppe noen utviklingsfond av Norfunds type vil kunne gjøre slike investeringer idag.\n",
      "Tilsvarende er det vanskelig å finne prosjekter i primærlandbruk i Afrika som ikke risikerer betydelig kritikk fra NGOer med hensyn til landrettigheter og håndtering av lokalsamfunn. Dette gjør at vi nå er mer tilbakeholdende med slike prosjekter. Og selv der vi selv mener at vi lykkes, er det helt sikkert en NGO som legger bredsiden til med kritikk.\n",
      "I forbindelse med Verdensbankens årsmøte i høst møtte vi andre tilsvarende investeringsfond som Norfund. Alle opplevde at det er utrolig vanskelig å få med private investorer til fattige land og at de høye kravene gjør det stadig vanskeligere også for oss med et utviklingsmandat.\n",
      "Tydelige krav og retningslinjer for næringslivet er viktig. Men slik situasjonen er i dag, med urealistiske forventningene til hva kommersielle aktører skal utrede, dokumentere, håndtere, ta ansvar for og selvsagt betale for - så blir det nærmest umulig å satse i de fattigste landene, der vi trengs mest.\n",

      "\n",
      "Kjell Roland liker å kalle en spade for en spade. Tydelighet er en forutsetning for å lede en organisasjon som får til verdiskaping i fattige land, mener han. Norfund har 71 ansatte fra mange land, 45 av disse er på Oslo-kontoret. Satsingsområdene er ren energi, mikrofinans og banker, ikke minst i ”agrobusiness .\n",
      "–I dag ser vi at vestlige verdier er på vei ned i mange utviklingsland. Fordi mye av den tradisjonelle bistanden ikke bidrar til å løse de egentlige fattigdomsproblemene, sier Kjell Roland.\n",
      "I den kategorien vil ikke Norfund havne. Norfund er en kunnskapsbedrift, tuftet på idealsime og sosial kapitalisme, men de driver ikke med giverbistand.  \n",
      "Investeringsfondet forvalter norske skattebetaleres penger, da den norske stat eier Norfund. Organisasjonen skaper synlige resultater i motsetning til mye av tradisjonell bistand. Det utdypes i denne saken.  \n",
      "Kjell Roland ser det globale bildet tydeligere enn mange andre. Norfund er med å definere én av Norges roller i fattige land, i likhet og forskjellig fra andre organisasjoner.\n",
      " –Hjemme skal vi forklare hva vi gjør til våre ”stake holders” til sivilsamfunnet og til politikerne som lever i en helt annen virkelighet, sier lederen i Norfund.\n",
      "Ideén til Norfund kom på en tid da bistanden gjenoppdaget betydningen av arbeidsplasser og lønnsomt næringsliv Å gi hjelp til selvhjelp er lønnsomt på sikt. Det beviser Norfund med sine investeringer.\n",
      " – Vi ansetter lokale mennesker på våre regionale kontorer, mennesker som kan språk, kultur og har et nettverk i næringslivet. Vi bruker store ressurser på å utvikle felles holdninger  på tvers av nasjonalitet, kultur og religion. Det er avgjørende i kunnskapsbedrifter å bygge kultur. Samtidig er det er utfordrende å få dem som er ute til å forstå den norske kulturen og det krever veldig tydelig ledelse. Vi har en uformell og flat struktur uten komitévelde, og understreker samtidig hvem som har ansvar og hvor beslutningslinjene går.   Jeg observerer at det i Vesten skjer en ekstrem byråkratisering også i næringslivet, med mange prosesser, dokumentasjon og kontroller. I Norfund, er det derimot avgjørende at prosjektlederen har ansvar, vet hva som er viktig og handler fornuftig deretter.\n",
      " Våre investeringer krever først og fremst erfaring, teamarbeid og godt skjønn. Vi kan ikke redusere beslutningsprosessene til ferdigskrevne manualer eller «tikke bokser». Hvordan bedriften opptrer i lokalsamfunnet er ofte avgjørende, vi må forstå hvem som får nytten av en bedrift og hvordan samfunnet fungerer. Dette dreier seg i hovedsak om forhold som i Norge tas for gitt og ikke er bedriftens ansvar. Sunn fornuft og smertefulle erfaringer er sterkt undervurdert og kan bli fortrengt av byråkratiseringen. Jeg er opptatt av tydelig ansvar og å trekke på alle relevante ressurser. Det skal ikke finnes tvil om hvor ansvaret ligger\n",
      " Hele Norfund samles i Oslo en uke i året hvor vi prøver å lære av det som har gått bra og det som ikke har fungert så bra.\n",
      " –Norge er i ”utkanten” av utviklingslandene, men vår kultur må bli forstått også. Vi ønsker å ha en uformell og flat struktur, men samtidig være ekstremt tydelig. Det krever tydelig ledelse. Vi vil ha en kultur der folk tar ansvar og ikke pulveriserer det. Det dreier seg om vanskelige investeringer der vi må stole på folk, forklarer Roland.\n",
      " – Språk er viktig. Det skal være tydelig, og man skal kalle en spade for en spade. I bistandsindustrien er språkformen ofte vassen og utydelig, og man mister lett forståelsen av hva som er viktigst. Alt henger sammen med alt. FN-språket er det ofte ikke mulig å få tak i. Organisasjoner blir dermed sårbare for kritikk fordi de lover langt mer enn det som er mulig å få til. Dersom det er vanskelig å måle resultater er det også vanskelig å holde folk ansvarlige for resultatene. Vi snakker derfor om hva som er Norfund’s mandat og mål og hvordan vi tenker å oppnå disse.\n",
      "– Norfunds styrke er at vi er på bakken, vi investerer og skaper lønnsomme bedrifter i land og kulturer som er dramatisk forskjellige fra Norge. Vi er en investor som opererer på kommersielle vilkår, alltid med lokale partnere. Norad er et direktorat og dermed en del av forvaltningen.  Norfund investerer og skaper lønnsomme bedrifter. Vi jobber med partnere som har samme interesse som oss, i land og kulturer som er dramatisk forskjellige fra Norge. Vi er en investor som opererer på kommersielle vilkår. Vi bruker et universelt «språk» som alle i næringslivet forstår på tvers av landegrensene. Suksesskriteriet er enkelt; lønnsomme bedrifter som betaler anstendige lønninger og skatt, som har høy standarder på miljø og sosiale forhold. Og null toleranse for korrupsjon. Da er vårt mål oppnådd.\n",
      "Norad driver gavebistand og har et større og bredere palett av målsetninger, som er både motstridende og kompliserte å måle.\n",
      "–Norfund’s oppdrag er det som i Norge kalles arbeidslinjen. Vårt mandat er tuftet på forståelsen av at langsiktig bærekraftig kamp mot fattigdom bare kan lykkes hvis folk får arbeid og inntekter. Alle norske partier er enige i at dette er prioritet nummer én i Norge i dag. Selvsagt er dette enda riktigere i fattige land, denne forståelsen er ”gjenoppdaget” i bistandspolitikken i siste årene. Norfund skaper jobber, økonomisk vekst, leverer strøm, bygger banker og infrastruktur.\n",
      "Det viktigste dagens bistand kan brukes til er å bidra til et styrket næringsliv i utviklingslandene som gjør dem egnet til selv å generere nok kapital til å møte fattigdomsutfordringen, mener Norfund.\n",
      "–Skal fattige land komme tilnærmelsesvis opp på vårt velstandsnivå, må deres egen verdiskaping mangedobles. Det er mulig. Flere land har lykkes. Land som i utgangspunktet var ressursfattige land, mangedoblet sin verdiskaping på få tiår, og Kina viser vei. Vestlig bistand har sporet av, i motsetning til Kina. Kina i Afrika gjør det samme i Afrika som ble gjort i Kina for 20 år siden. Vesten har ikke mennesker med den erfaringen. Vesten har mennesker som har gått på universiteter, men som aldri har vært fattige og aldri har bekjempet fattigdom. Derfor består bistand veldig mye i å lage rapporter og reise på møter med andre donorer. Mens land som Kina, Mauritius, Vietnam og Sør Korea har lykkes ved heller å jobbe målrettet for å bekjempe fattigdom og øke verdiskapningen. I dag ser vi at vestlige verdier er på vei ned i mange utviklingsland. En del av den sørgelige historien er fordi vi ikke bidrar til å løse de egentlige fattigdomsproblemene, men har lange pekefingre og opptrer som om vi vet bedre enn landene selv. \n",
      "–Kina drar til Etiopia og bygger skofabrikker, eller til Kenya hvor de bygger jernbaner. Dette virker. Slik sluttet Norge å være fattig og det er slik det virker over alt, det har Kina gjort noe med. Hvis vi oppnår tusenårsmålene; så er det ikke på grunn av bistand, men på grunn av næringsutvikling og infrastruktur. Denne erkjennelsen ligger bak opptrappingen av kapitaltilførselen til Norfund. Vi investerer 2.5 til 3 milliarder kroner årlig. Første år fikk vi tildelt 1.5 milliarder og nå er den totale porteføljen blitt rundt 17 milliarder kroner.\n",
      "– Den norske stat burde bygge opp Norfund til én prosent av oljefondet, 100 milliarder i løpet av neste 5-8 år. Det ville kunne skape to millioner arbeidsplasser i bedriftene vi har investert i og levere ren energi til 200 millioner mennesker. Og gjennom dette ville Norge blitt en viktigere partner for Afrika. I Afrika finnes det ikke ett demokratisk og velfungerende land der arbeid og energi ikke står øverst på prioriteringslista. Skal vi på sikt få oppslutning om menneskerettigheter og likestilling må vi bli denne type partner som kan bidra med å hjelpe til å løse det som er egentlige utviklingsproblemer. Det handler mye om ledelsesfilosofi mener jeg. Med 17 nasjonaliteter er det en komplisert oppgave å bygge kvalitet i det investeringsarbeidet vi gjør og bygge bro hjem til våre norske «stakeholders» slik at de forstår hva og hvorfor vi gjør det vi gjør. Vi kan ikke skape drømmebedrifter.  Mange har urealistiske forventninger om hva som er mulig. Norfunds oppgave er å være tydelig på hva vi kan og hva vi ikke kan. Og internt i egen organisasjon å sette mål som er realiserbare og levere lønnsomme bedrifter som vokser og skaper verdier i fattige land.\n",

L’offre d’accompagnement technique de Proparco repose sur le principe de partage des coûts entre Proparco et le client.\n",

      "L’action de Proparco permet de combler les lacunes des systèmes financiers locaux qui ne sont pas toujours en mesure d’offrir des financements adaptés aux besoins de leurs économies. Proparco remplit cet objectif sans provoquer de distorsion de marché ou d’effets d’éviction des acteurs financiers privés, notamment des banques commerciales locales et internationales.\n",
      "Elle intervient en complément de leur offre (principe de subsidiarité), à des conditions aussi similaires que possible à celles du marché, sans subventions ou élément de concessionnalité. En déployant une gamme complète d’instruments financiers, du prêt senior aux fonds propres en passant par l’obligation convertible ou la garantie, Proparco est en mesure de répondre à la plupart des besoins de financements qui ne seraient pas couverts par les acteurs privés.\n",
      "Au-delà de leur subsidiarité, ses interventions ont pour finalité de contribuer à des avancées concrètes en matière de développement durable dans les pays du Sud (principe d’additionnalité).\n",
      "Proparco propose des prêts (3 à 100 M€), en devise ou en monnaie locale, à des entreprises et des institutions financières sur des durées longues (jusqu’à 20 ans), avec un différé de remboursement du capital lorsqu’il se justifie.\n",
      "Elle offre des solutions globales de financement et peut syndiquer des montants importants grâce à des mécanismes de co-financement avec ses partenaires, notamment européens (FMO, DEG).\n",
      "Les entreprises peuvent ainsi accéder à des fonds propres, indispensables à leur développement, ainsi qu’à un accompagnement rapproché dans la définition de leur stratégie, l’amélioration de leur gouvernance ou encore l’accès à des réseaux professionnels internationaux.\n",
      "Par sa signature, Proparco peut apporter une garantie de solvabilité ou de liquidité. Cette garantie peut prendre des formes variées et avoir différents types de sous-jacents : prêt en devise ou en monnaie locale, emprunt obligataire, OPCVM coté sur un marché financier, etc.\n",
      "Proparco facilite ainsi la mobilisation de ressources auprès de banques ou de souscripteurs institutionnels, et peut agir sur la profondeur et la liquidité des marchés financiers.\n",
      "Un grand nombre de sociétés, notamment celles de petits tailles, ne dispose pas de revenus en euro ou en dollar. Pour réduire leur exposition au risque de change susceptible de les fragiliser, Proparco recherche des solutions de financement en monnaie locale. Selon les cas, elle a recours aux marchés financiers qui proposent des instruments de couverture sur les principales devises (peso mexicain, rand sud-africain, roupie indienne…) ou au fonds multi-bailleurs Currency Exchange Fund (TCX). Ce fonds lui donne accès à des produits de couverture de change pour des devises moins courantes.\n",

      "L’Asie abrite aujourd’hui plus de la moitié de l’humanité. Géant démographique, la région est aussi la locomotive de l’économie mondiale : elle contribue au tiers du PIB mondial. Mais cet essor rapide se traduit par des besoins énergétiques croissants et une pression de plus en plus forte sur le milieu naturel et la biodiversité. \n",
      "L’Asie est aujourd’hui la première source mondiale d’émission des gaz à effet de serre, responsables du changement climatique. La région est également confrontée à des enjeux sociaux inédits, liés à son urbanisation exponentielle et à la pauvreté encore marquée de ses populations : l’Asie abrite les deux tiers des pauvres de la planète. À cela s’ajoute un déficit infrastructurel important : 1,7 milliard de personnes n’ont pas accès à des installations d’assainissement et 680 millions à l’électricité.\n",
      "En Asie, l’action de Proparco s’inscrit dans le cadre de la stratégie régionale de l’AFD . Son objectif : contribuer à une croissance respectueuse de l’environnement et des équilibres régionaux. \n",
      "réduire l’empreinte environnementale de la croissance asiatique, à travers le développement des énergies renouvelables (solaire, éolien, biomasse, hydroélectricité) et de l’efficacité énergétique dans les bâtiments, les transports, l’industrie… ;\n",
      "la cohésion sociale et l’accès des populations les plus pauvres à des biens et services essentiels dans les pays à revenu faible ou moyen inférieur : eau, santé, éducation, formation professionnelle… ;\n",
      "développer une microfinance responsable, notamment par des intermédiaires financiers pour favoriser l’inclusion financière des populations et l’auto-emploi ;\n",
      "améliorer la production agro-industrielle dans les pays les moins avancés (Bangladesh, Cambodge, Laos…) pour favoriser leur développement face aux grands pays émergents et accroitre leur capacité à répondre aux besoins alimentaires locaux.\n",

      "Comme plusieurs pays africains, le développement économique et social du Sénégal pâtit des sous-performances de son secteur de l’énergie. Avec une puissance installée de 843 MW en 2015 (à titre de comparaison, le Maroc dispose d’une puissance dix fois supérieure), le réseau national peine à répondre aux besoins grandissants des entreprises et des particuliers. \n",
      "Les raisons de cette faiblesse sont multiples, à commencer par un sous-investissement en capacité de production pendant plus d’une décennie et une forte dépendance du pays aux combustibles fossiles (les centrales thermiques assurent 90 % de la production). Le pire a été atteint en 2008-2011 : la crise pétrolière mondiale a plongé le Sénégal dans une crise énergétique profonde, qui s’est traduite par des délestages massifs et une grave crise sociale (« émeutes de l’électricité » en 2011).\n",
      "À cela s’ajoute un coût de l’électricité parmi les plus élevés en Afrique de l’Ouest (près de deux fois plus élevé qu’en Côte d’Ivoire), malgré le gel des tarifs en 2009 et les subventions importantes accordées jusqu’en 2014 par l’État à la compagnie nationale, la Senelec. Selon le FMI, le coût de ce soutien public au secteur représenterait plus de 2 % du PIB.\n"

Sont soumis à l’appréciation du Comité d’investissement consultatif les projets les plus importants (en termes de montants et/ou de risques).\n",

      "Aux côtés de l’Agence Française de Développement, son principal souscripteur, participent au développement de ses activités des institutions financières publiques et privées françaises, africaines et latino-américaines, des sociétés de services, des industriels actifs dans ses pays d’intervention, ainsi que des fonds et fondations éthiques.\n",
      "La pluralité d’horizons des actionnaires de Proparco est l’une de ses forces : cette communauté d’investisseurs du Nord et du Sud partage un même engagement en faveur du développement durable. Au fil de leur entrée successive depuis l’ouverture du capital en 1990, ils ont joué et jouent un rôle décisif dans le pilotage stratégique et la bonne gouvernance de l’institution.\n",

      "Elle permet aux personnes exclus du secteur bancaire – notamment les petits producteurs ruraux et les actifs du secteur informel, au premier rang desquels les femmes – d’accéder à des services financiers adaptés à leurs besoins (micro-crédit, micro-assurance, épargne, moyens de paiement…) pour développer leur activité, sécuriser leur revenu et faire face aux aléas de la vie (maladie, décès...).\n",
      "C’est dans cette logique que Proparco intervient pour soutenir l’émergence et le développement d’acteurs solides et responsables : des IMF, des banques ou encore des fonds engagés dans le secteur de la microfinance.\n",
      "À travers l’octroi de prêts, notamment en monnaie locale, ou des prises de participation, Proparco participe à l’augmentation des capacités de financement local, ainsi qu’à la solidité et la stabilité financières des acteurs du secteur.\n",
      "Avant tout concours, Proparco porte la plus grande attention à la stratégie des IMF en matière de rentabilité : aucun financement n’est accordé à des institutions qui génèrent des profits importants au détriment de leurs clients.\n",
      "Les interventions de Proparco ont pour objectif de promouvoir une microfinance responsable. Dans cette perspective, Proparco conseille et appuie ses partenaires sur les questions de gouvernance et de sécurité financière, les problématiques environnementales et sociales, mais aussi dans la mise en place de mesures de protection de leur clientèle, notamment contre le surendettement.\n",
      "Pour répondre à la demande croissante (plus de 90 millions de clients à travers le monde en 2012), la microfinance s’est progressivement structurée, réglementée, et la palette d’acteurs élargie.\n",
      "Aux côtés des ONG, qui ont longtemps porté l’activité, les banques commerciales ont développé des offres dédiées. De même, des véhicules d’investissement ont été créés pour faciliter la mobilisation des capitaux nécessaires au développement de l’activité des institutions de microfinance (IMF), tout en assurant un certain rendement aux investisseurs.\n",
      "La microfinance est aujourd’hui une composante essentielle du système financier dans les pays du Sud, mais elle a encore de nombreux défis à relever : à commencer par rester un outil au service du développement et de l’inclusion financière des populations, en maintenant l’équilibre entre sa mission sociale et sa viabilité économique.\n",

      "Le Sri Lanka est, depuis longtemps, réputé pour ses épices (cannelle, poivre, girofle, muscade, etc.). Avec les produits dérivés et les huiles essentielles, elles représentent encore plus de 50 % des exportations agricoles du pays. \n",
      "La société MA’s Foods est une des plus réputées du secteur. Créée il y a 30 ans à Dambulla, une localité au voisinage des meilleures plantations de l’île, MA’s Foods a démarré son activité avec la transformation d’épices, et seulement cinq employés. Elle a ensuite progressivement élargi sa gamme de produits aux confitures, chutneys, pâtes de curry, mélanges d’épices, etc. Elle possède aujourd’hui cinq marques et a investi, depuis 2006, la production de dérivés du coco (lait et poudre). \n",
      "La micro-entreprise s’est muée en société prospère, forte de 300 employés. Pour assurer ce développement, son fondateur, Mario de Aldwis, a su trouver les ressources auprès d’acteurs financiers et d’investisseurs locaux et internationaux. Le dernier en date : un fonds du gestionnaire indien Aavishkaar, dont Proparco est devenue actionnaire en 2015, et qui a investi 2,1 millions de dollars dans l’entreprise (voir encadré p. 27). \n",
      "L’homme a aussi su anticiper les attentes du marché. Sa société a, par exemple, été la première au Sri Lanka à obtenir, en 2003, une certification pour son système de gestion de la sécurité sanitaire des aliments (SQF). Deux ans plus tard, elle obtenait les labels « bio » de l’Union européenne et du Japon. Puis, à leur suite, les certifications FSSC 22000 (sécurité alimentaire), ISO 14001(management environnemental), ISO 18001 (santé et sécurité au travail), commerce équitable, agriculture biologique (Europe, Japon, États-Unis) et Sedex (commerce éthique).\n",
      "L’autre clé du succès de MA’s Foods est d’avoir fait le choix d’un business model inclusif, explique Mario de Alwis. « Depuis le début, nous avons conçu MA’s comme une société en lien avec son environnement: les habitants de Dambulla, les planteurs alentour... ». \n",
      "Pour lui, ce qui fait la différence avec d’autres acteurs nationaux de l’agro-industrie, « c’est l’enracinement local, la prise en compte des gens avec qui nous travaillons. Sans cela, il est possible de se faire une place sur le marché mais pas de durer. Dans cette industrie, certains oublient que leur réussite, ils la doivent avant tout aux hommes et aux femmes qui travaillent pour eux. Vous pouvez avoir les meilleures technologies et les meilleures machines, au bout du compte, ce sont les planteurs qui ont les mains dans la terre, les employés de nos usines qui sélectionnent et préparent les produits. Et si vous passez à côté de cela, vous passez à côté de votre métier. » \n",
      "Chez MA’s Foods, 50 % des employés sont des femmes. Deux d’entre elles sont managers et quatre, assistantes de managers (contre sept hommes). Des chiffres dont Mario peut s’enorgueillir dans un pays où deux Sri-Lankaises sur trois sont sans activité professionnelle. \n",
      "Dans l’enceinte de ses usines, MA’s Foods fournit gratuitement le logement et les repas à ses salariés. À Dambulla, une centaine d’entre eux résident sur place pendant la semaine de travail. Si ce service a un coût, il contribue aussi à sécuriser l’activité de l’usine. Et pour les employés, il représente un avantage non négligeable lorsque la location d’un appartement d’une pièce oscille ailleurs entre 40 et 60 euros par mois et où les dépenses alimentaires coûtent autant – pour des salaires atteignant à peine 100 à 300 euros par mois.\n",
      "Mais l’engagement communautaire de MA’s Foods ne s’arrête pas là. Pour son approvisionnement, elle privilégie l’achat auprès des petits exploitants agricoles qu’elle accompagne par ailleurs dans l’adoption de pratiques responsables. \n",
      "Dans ce but, elle a initié la structuration d’un réseau de planteurs engagés pour une agriculture durable : Safenet (Sustainable Agri-Farmers Enterprise Network). L’objectif ? Les aider à satisfaire aux standards internationaux des certifications du commerce équitable et de l’agriculture biologique. Les équipes de MA’s leur apportent conseil, assistance technique et formation. Le coût des certifications est pris en charge par MA’s Foods. \n",
      "Dans les cocoteraies du sud de l’île, le label « bio » a permis aux planteurs du réseau Safenet de vendre leur production 300 à 400 roupies le kilo plus cher que les prix du conventionnel. Malgré cela, Rajeewa Kularathna, responsable de la conformité à Dambulla, reconnaît que la tâche peut être ardue : « Il est parfois difficile de faire bouger les pratiques et de faire comprendre aux planteurs les bénéfices qu’ils peuvent tirer des certifications. D’autant que cela peut prendre jusqu’à cinq ans pour obtenir le label “commerce équitable” et deux à trois ans pour le bio. » \n",
      "En soutenant l’essor de l’agriculture biologique au Sri Lanka et le commerce équitable, le fondateur de MA’s Foods ne cache pas son espoir de contribuer à revaloriser l’activité agricole. \n",
      "« Comme ailleurs dans le monde, elle a perdu de son attractivité. Nos jeunes cherchent à quitter les campagnes. Pour eux, l’agriculture, c’est le choix ultime, la dernière solution quand ils ont échoué ailleurs. Je suis inquiet pour l’avenir. Dans 50 ans, il nous faudra nourrir trois millions d’êtres humains supplémentaires. Comment allons-nous faire si personne ne veut travailler la terre ? Le Sri Lanka a la chance d’avoir le potentiel naturel et humain pour contribuer à relever ce défi, mais pour l’instant, rares sont les initiatives pour fédérer l’ensemble des acteurs et développer une agro-industrie durable à l’échelle nationale, dans l’intérêt des paysans, de notre économie, du pays. » \n",
      "Face à ce défi, Mario de Alwis dit vouloir assurer la pérennité du travail accompli : « Après avoir fait grandir MA’s, il faut penser à l’étape suivante. Je ne suis pas éternel, il est important pour moi d’assurer ma succession ». Cette relève, Mario l’a déjà préparée. Son fils aîné, Maliek, est l’actuel PDG de MA’s Foods et le plus jeune, Sheran, est directeur de la conformité.\n",

      "Malgré des besoins importants et un fort potentiel de croissance, le continent africain apparaît encore très en retrait du marché mondial du médicament. La production locale peine à se faire une place dans un marché pharmaceutique africain alimenté à 70 % par les importations étrangères.\n",
      "Face au développement attendu de ce secteur en Afrique, les synergies entre acteurs publics et privés sont incontournables. Les acteurs privés sont de plus en plus sollicités par les pouvoirs publics comme une alternative aux systèmes, parfois défaillants, d’approvisionnement et de distribution des médicaments.\n",
      "Mais alors, quels sont les freins au développement de ces acteurs privés sur le continent ? Comment permettre aux patients d’accéder à des médicaments répondant à leurs besoins et en nombre suffisant ? Comment rendre les prix abordables ? Comment garantir un niveau satisfaisant de qualité, de sécurité et d’efficacité ? Comment transformer les chaines d’approvisionnement aujourd’hui trop fragmentées ce qui explique qu’en dépit d’un coût de production bas, les médicaments vendus en Afrique subsaharienne sont souvent les plus chers au monde ?\n",
      "Autant de questions d’actualités auxquelles ce nouveau numéro de la revue Secteur Privé & Développement tente d’apporter des pistes de solution. La revue donne la parole à des experts, des chercheurs, des organisations de santé publique, par exemple sur la question des brevets, et des acteurs privés africains comme la start up mPharma ou Pharmivoire Nouvelle, entreprise pionnière dans la production locale de produits pharmaceutiques en Côte d’Ivoire.\n",
      "Africa is having to contend with a major public health challenge, namely access to quality medicines. This problem is currently being made even more acute by the growth in chronic diseases, demographic transition and the emergence of middle classes who are willing and able to set aside part of their budget for health expenditure.\n",
      "In spite of colossal needs and serious growth potential, Africa is still lagging far behind on the global market for medicine. Local production is struggling and 70% of the Continent’s requirements are met by foreign imports.\n",
      "Given forecast development in this sector, unlocking synergies between public and private stakeholders will be absolutely vital.  Governments are increasingly turning to private businesses to supply and distribute medicine as an alternative to systems that have failed to prove their worth.\n",
      "So, what obstacles do these private players face when doing business in Africa? How can patients be provided with proper access to sufficient quantities of suitable and affordable medicine? And how can we ensure satisfactory levels of quality, safety and effectiveness? What is the most effective way of transforming excessively fragmented supply chains? This factor explains why, despite low production costs, the drugs on sale in Sub-Saharan Africa are frequently among the most expensive in the world.\n",
      "This new edition of Private Sector & Development tackles all of these issues and attempts to come up with a few pointers and solutions for the future.

      "En complémentarité avec le secteur public, les opérateurs privés jouent un rôle de plus en plus important dans le développement d’une offre de santé et d’éducation abordable et de qualité.\n",
      "L’allongement de la durée de vie, la forte prévalence des maladies infectieuses et la pression croissante des maladies chroniques (diabète, cancer, maladies cardiovasculaires) posent des défis inédits aux systèmes de santé dans les pays en développement et émergents.\n",
      "Pour répondre à ces évolutions, des investissements massifs sont nécessaires – au-delà des capacités de financement public dans la plupart des pays du Sud. Une coopération efficace avec le secteur privé peut permettre d’organiser et d’améliorer durablement l’offre de soins, en faisant émerger des solutions adaptées.\n",
      "Dans cette perspective, Proparco soutient le financement d’établissements hospitaliers et de cliniques privées de qualité, mais aussi la formation du personnel, la création de nouvelles spécialités (oncologie, chirurgie pédiatrique), l’achat de plateaux techniques de dernière génération…\n",
      "La disponibilité des médicaments, efficaces et abordables, représente également un enjeu majeur pour traiter des maladies prioritaires comme le paludisme, le VIH/sida, la tuberculose, ou chroniques comme le cancer ou le diabète.\n",

      "La collaboration et la coordination avec ses pairs sont des leviers essentiels à l’efficacité de Proparco, et l’un des moteurs de sa croissance. Elles permettent la réalisation d’opérations en cofinancement et la mobilisation de fonds communs pour faire émerger des projets d’envergure, qui représentent une part croissance de l’activité de Proparco.\n",
      "Elles favorisent également l’adoption de règles, de procédures et de standards communs qui participent à l’uniformisation des pratiques et rendent possible la construction d’outils et d’indicateurs harmonisés d’évaluation des projets et de mesure des résultats.\n",
      "Enfin, cette coopération entre les équipes de Proparco et leurs homologues d’autres institutions et agences de développement, facilite le partage d’informations et de savoir-faire à l’occasion d’échanges et de rencontres réguliers.\n",
      "L’ association des institutions européennes de financement du développement (EDFI) sous son acronyme en anglais) est l’une des concrétisations les plus dynamiques de cette collaboration de Proparco avec ses pairs.\n",
      "Créée en 1992, elle réunit 15 institutions bilatérales européennes dédiées au financement du secteur privé dans les pays du Sud.\n",
      "Sous l’impulsion d’EDFI, Proparco a par exemple adopté plusieurs accords communs avec ses homologues européens encadrant ses investissements, à l’instar des principes directeurs pour des financements responsables . EDFI a également permis la création de deux fonds :\n",
      "Pour faciliter le partage et la capitalisation d’expériences, Proparco collabore également avec les membres d’EDFI à la réalisation d’évaluations sur les opérations menées conjointement.\n",
      "Créé en 2004 par la Banque européenne d’investissement (BEI) et 12 membres d’EDFI, dont Proparco, l’European Financing Partners (EFP) est une coentreprise dédiée au financement d’opérations du secteur privé dans les pays d’Afrique, des Caraïbes et du Pacifique (ACP).\n",
      "En 2014, la capacité totale de financement de l’EFP s’élève à 230 millions d’euros pour des projets individuels jusqu’à 25 millions d’euros. L’EFP contribue au maximum à 75 % du coût d’un projet, dont 50 % apportés par la BEI, le membre d’EDFI à son origine apporte les 25 % restants. \n",
      "L’EFP contribue à promouvoir le développement durable du secteur privé dans les pays ACP, mais aussi à renforcer la coopération entre les institutions financières européennes, notamment entre les membres d’EDFI et la BEI.\n",
      "Depuis sa création, l’EFP a approuvé 32 projets pour un montant total de 442 millions d’euros à la fin 2013. Plusieurs opérations réalisées par Proparco ont bénéficié de sous-participations de l’EFP, à l’instar de projets de télécoms en Tanzanie (Millicom) et d’énergie en Jamaïque (JPS), ainsi que d’infrastructures en Afrique subsaharienne (Africa Finance Corporation).\n",
      "Créé en 2011 par l’AFD, la Banque européenne d’investissement (BEI), Proparco et 10 autres IEFD, l’Interact Climate Change Facility (ICCF) est un fonds commun d’investissement dédié au financement d’opérations du secteur privé en faveur des énergies renouvelables (éolien, solaire, hydroélectrique…) et de l’efficacité énergétique dans les pays en développement et émergents. Cette initiative fait aujourd’hui figure d’exemple en matière de coopération financière et technique entre bailleurs en faveur de projets climat.\n",
      "L’objectif de l’ICCF est de contribuer à la réduction des émissions de gaz à effet de serre et de promouvoir les meilleures pratiques en matière environnementale et sociale.\n",
      "Sur la période 2012-2014, l’ICCF a permis d’engager 269M€ sur 15 projets « climat » apportés par ses membres, au premier rang desquels Proparco, le FMO et la DEG. L’ICCF contribue au maximum aux deux tiers du coût, en prêt senior ou subordonné, le membre d’EDFI à son origine apportant le tiers restant.\n",
      "À ce jour, l’AFD et Proparco comptent parmi ses principaux contributeurs, en termes d’apport financier (165 M€ cumulés sur 458 M€ disponibles, soit 36%) et des montants engagés (101 M€ sur un total de 269 M€, soit 38%).\n",
      "Au sein d’EDFI, Proparco entretient des relations étroites avec ses homologues allemand et néerlandais, DEG et FMO , respectivement depuis 1998 et 2007.\n",
      "En 2012, les trois institutions ont créé une facilité de cofinancement qui permet la mutualisation de leurs moyens et la délégation à l’un des trois partenaires de l’instruction et du suivi des projets. Cette coordination leur permet de se positionner ensemble sur des transactions allant jusqu’à 90 millions d’euros.\n",
      "En 2014, 25 % de l’activité de Proparco a été réalisée avec ses homologues allemands et néerlandais, DEG et FMO .\n",
      "En octobre 2009, Proparco a signé un accord de coopération avec la Société financière internationale (SFI), filiale de la Banque mondiale spécialisée dans le financement du secteur privé destiné à faciliter les démarches de cofinancement de projets dans des secteurs clés du développement : l’agro-industrie, les énergies renouvelables, l’efficacité énergétique, les banques et marchés financiers…\n",
      "Dans une même volonté d’accroître son champ d’action et ses impacts, Proparco multiplie les collaborations avec ses actionnaires.\n",
      "Des projets ont, par exemple, été financés dans le tourisme, les infrastructures et la microfinance avec la Fondation Aga Khan pour le développement économique (AKFED).\n",
      "Deux fonds de fonds pour la Méditerranée ( Averroès Finance I et II ) ont également été créés avec Bpifrance pour soutenir le financement des PME dans la région Méditerranée. Leur réussite a conduit au lancement d’Averroès Finance III destiné au développement du capital investissement en Afrique subsaharienne.\n",
      "Des accords de coopération, notamment technique et financière, sont également noués entre des actionnaires de Proparco et, plus largement, le groupe AFD, comme avec la Banque de développement pour l’Afrique australe (DBSA).\n",

      "Le changement climatique est aujourd’hui une réalité tangible. Face à cette menace, Proparco et son actionnaire de réfrence, l’AFD, se sont engagés depuis dix ans dans une stratégie d’actions ambitieuse. Ensemble, elles ont mobilisé près de 18 Md€ pour des projets ayant des impacts positifs sur le climat.\n",
      "Cela nous positionne comme l’un des bailleurs les plus actifs en la matière. Il s’agit là d’un engagement pérenne : Proparco s’est fixée comme objectif de consacrer 30 % de ses financements annuels à la lutte contre le changement climatique. Elle accompagne ainsi les acteurs privés qui transforment le défi climatique en opportunité pour le développement durable de secteurs tels que les infrastructures, l’industrie, l’agriculture...\n",
      "Aujourd’hui, notre «clim’action» se décline sur des fronts multiples. Dans le cadre des initiatives engagées autour de la conférence des parties sur le climat à Paris (COP 21), le groupe AFD participe activement au renforcement des synergies entre bailleurs, à l’harmonisation des pratiques et des outils en matière de finance climat, etc.\n",
      "Aux côtés de ses partenaires européens, PROPARCO a également contribué à la création d’un mécanisme dédié au cofinancement de projets d’énergies renouvelables et d’efficacité énergétique à l’initiative du secteur privé dans les pays en développement et émergents : Interact Climate Change Facility . Lequel compte aujourd’hui comme l’une des réalisations les plus abouties en matière de collaboration entre bailleurs.\n",
      "Au total, 23 projets pour une valeur de 377milliards d’euros ont été approuvés par le biais de la facilité ICCF au deuxième trimestre de 2017.\n",
      "Le développement des énergies renouvelables (solaire,éolienne, hydro-électrique, géothermique, biomasse, etc.) représente une réponse viable et pérenne à l’accroissement de la demande énergétique mondiale, tout en participant à la lutte contre le dérèglement climatique. Ces technologies permettent de diversifier les mix énergétiques nationaux, de réduire la dépendance des économies aux sources fossiles (pétrole, charbon, gaz) et de limiter les émissions de GES.\n",
      "Le développement, la production et l’utilisation d’EnR ont également un effet d’entraînement sur les économies. Elles offrent de nombreuses opportunités en matière de création d’emplois, de richesse, de recherche et développement, etc. Mais cela implique des investissements massifs, des politiques volontaristes et incitatives, ainsi que l’ouverture du marché aux producteurs indépendants d’électricité. L’enjeu est d’atteindre à court ou moyen terme la parité des coûts avec les filières conventionnelles de production d’énergie.\n",
      "Les entreprises, et plus spécifiquement le secteur de l’industrie, sont d’importants consommateurs d’énergie. Ce niveau de consommation se traduit non seulement par une dépendance aux sources d’énergie fossile (gaz, pétrole, charbon) et par des charges financières élevées, mais il pose aussi la question de leur responsabilité environnementale. Le seul secteur du ciment est, par exemple, à l’origine de 5 % des émissions de CO2 – une part qui pourrait dépasser les 10 % d’ici à 2050.\n",
      "L’efficacité énergétique constitue un élément de réponse. En récupérant la chaleur produite lors d’un procédé de production ou de transformation, les entreprises disposent d’une source d’approvisionnement en énergie.\n",
      "L’accès durable à l’énergie est un levier essentiel du développement économique et social. Les services énergétiques ont des impacts multiples et profonds sur la productivité des entreprises, l’éducation, etc.\n",
      "Aujourd’hui, les Nations unies estiment que 1,4 milliard de personnes n’ont pas accès à une énergie moderne, tandis que 3 milliards de personnes dépendent de la « biomasse traditionnelle » et du charbon comme source principale de combustible. L’Afrique demeure le continent où l’accès à l’électricité est le plus faible : moins d’un foyer sur deux en moyenne. Déficit d’infrastructures et de compétences techniques sont les deux principaux facteurs de la sous-performance du secteur dans la région.\n",
      "Dans ce contexte, les projets off grid représentent des solutions innovantes et désormais accessibles aux populations les plus modestes.\n",
      "En 2050, plus de 70 % de la population mondiale vivra dans les villes. Centres de consommation énergétique majeurs, les espaces urbains sont à la fois l’une des principales causes du changement climatique et l’un des principaux vecteurs pour réduire les émissions de gaz à effet de serre.\n",
      "En matière de capacité de transport, de coût par kilomètre, de longévité des infrastructures, de sûreté, mais aussi de climat le transport ferroviaire est préférable à la route. Il s’avère aussi indispensable pour le transport de certaines matières premières ou le désenclavement de pays non côtiers.*\n",
      "En réponse à ces enjeux, PROPARCO participe au financement de transports collectifs propres urbains et interurbains, ainsi qu’au développement du rail pour le transport de passagers et de marchandises.\n",
      "Dans de nombreux pays, le changement climatique aura un impact extrêmement sévère sur la disponibilité des ressources en eau. À quoi s’ajoutent les conséquences de la pollution des cours d’eau, des nappes phréatiques...\n",
      "La gestion durable de l’eau potable, la protection de sa qualité et la maîtrise de la demande représentent l’un des enjeux du siècle. C’est pourquoi PROPARCO appuie des projets de gestion intégrée de la ressource hydrique, d’amélioration du rendement des réseaux d’eau, d’augmentation des capacités de stockage et d’assainissement des eaux usées dans les pays soumis à un fort stress hydrique.\n",
      "Demain, notre ambition est d’aller plus loin, de soutenir l’innovation et la créativité pour faire émerger des solutions techniques et financières. Les nouvelles technologies, comme la téléphonie mobile, offrent par exemple la possibilité de déployer des systèmes de distribution d’électricité off-grid sur le continent africain. Quant à nos collaborations avec nos pairs et les investisseurs traditionnels et nouveaux, elles nous permettront de développer de nouveaux produits en faveur du secteur : green bonds , subventions remboursables, réhaussement de crédit...\n",
      "Nous avons la certitude que le secteur privé sera un acteur clé pour la transition vers des économies plus respectueuses de leur environnement et bénéfiques au plus grand nombre d’hommes et de femmes. En tant qu’institution financière de développement, notre ambition est de leur permettre de jouer pleinement ce rôle.\n"

      "A cet effet, Proparco apporte de l’expertise et conseille ses clients afin d’améliorer les conditions de travail de leurs employés, de réduire leur empreinte carbone, de favoriser les relations avec les communautés locales, d’aider à obtenir des certifications E&S, d’éviter l’érosion de la biodiversité… ou encore d'améliorer la gouvernance de l'entreprise, Elle peut également financer de l’assistance technique destinée mettre en œuvre les mesures définies ensemble.\n",
      "En outre, Proparco mesure les impacts des projets financés sur le développement local et peut accompagner certains clients afin d'augmenter leurs impacts (revenus dans la chaîne de valeur des entreprises par exemple).\n",
      "Pour mener à bien cette mission, Proparco s’est dotée en 2010 d’une division « environnement, social, gouvernance et impacts » (ESGI) composée, à ce jour, de dix-huit personnes, appuyées par des consultants indépendants.\n",
      "Au-delà de sa contribution au développement économique, à travers la création de richesse et d’emplois, la construction d’infrastructures et l’insertion des pays dans le commerce mondial, le secteur privé a (au Sud comme au Nord) une responsabilité sociétale plus large : un développement durable et inclusif passe par l’engagement des entreprises et des institutions financières à agir de façon responsable.\n",
      "Cela suppose la maîtrise des risques et impacts de leur activité sur la société et l’environnement, l’adoption de pratiques éthiques et transparentes, le respect des lois en vigueur localement et des normes internationales fondamentales en matière de travail, de lutte contre la corruption, d’environnement, de droits de l’Homme...\n",
      "Dans les pays en développement, les enjeux environnementaux, sociaux et de gouvernance (ESG) gagnent du terrain, dans les grandes entreprises comme dans les PME.\n",
      "En sa qualité d’institution financière de développement, Proparco accompagne cette tendance et exige les meilleurs standards ESG au sein des sociétés qu’elle finance. Ils représentent en effet de puissants leviers garantissant aux entreprises des avantages comparatifs sur les marchés locaux et internationaux, une productivité et une rentabilité accrues et un signal positif pour les investisseurs. En ce sens, ils contribuent au développement des entreprises et à celui de leurs pays d’implantation.\n",
      "De par sa mission d’investisseur auprès de sociétés du Sud, Proparco s’engage sur des opérations comportant des risques environnementaux et sociaux (E&S).\n",
      "Pour les réduire, elle a consolidé depuis plusieurs années une démarche d’analyse et de gestion E&S, intégrant les exigences du groupe AFD , les principes communs aux bailleurs européens , les standards de performance de la SFI , les normes internationales de l’OIT , les critères de la FAO, de l'OCDE ou encore des principes aussi fondamentaux que ceux de la déclaration des droits de l’Homme.\n",
      "Au-delà de la maîtrise des risques, Proparco accompagne ses clients dans l’amélioration de leurs pratiques E&S. Elle peut également financer de l’assistance technique pour le renforcement des capacités du personnel, la mise en œuvre de systèmes de gestion E&S ou encore la certification d’entreprises (ISO 14 001, commerce équitable, FSC, etc.)\n",
      "Promouvoir la RSE passe ainsi, pour Proparco, par une incitation de ses clients à réduire leurs niveaux de pollution, limiter leurs consommations de ressources naturelles (notamment en eau et en énergie), ainsi que leurs émissions de gaz à effet de serre, protéger la biodiversité.\n",
      "Proparco porte également une attention particulière à la protection des droits des populations locales, aux conditions de travail des employés, aux femmes, à l’accès des populations locales aux biens et  services fournis par ses clients, notamment dans les secteurs de l’éducation, de la santé, de l'énergie.\n",
      "Proparco dispose d’une équipe de specialistes sur les thématiques E&S au sein de la division « environnement, social, gouvernance et impacts » (ESI).\n",
      "En fonction des besoins du client et des pistes d’amélioration identifiées lors de l'évaluation du projet, celle-ci peut définir avec le client un plan d’actions qui définit les actions à mettre en oeuvre, les responsabilités et les délais nécessaires. Ce plan constitue un engagement contractuel intégré à la convention de financement. Sa mise en œuvre est régulièrement évaluée par ESI.\n",
      "Pour les sociétés clientes de Proparco, la RSE constitue une étape essentielle à leur reconnaissance comme acteur responsable du développement, en ce qu’elle permet de maîtriser les risques de leur activité, de promouvoir des normes E&S élevées, d’attirer les investissements, d’accroître leur productivité (à travers la maitrise de leur consommation de ressources naturelles, la limitation des accidents du travail...), leur compétitivité et, in fine, leur contribution à l’amélioration des conditions de vie des populations et à la lutte contre la dégradation de l’environnement.\n",
      "A ce stade, les projets sont classés selon leurs risques E&S potentiels. Le classement E&S détermine le niveau et le type de diligences E&S à mener. \n",
      "Afin de bien évaluer les risques et opportunités E&S des projets et l’engagement des clients sur ces aspects, une due diligence est menée par le biais de visites sur site de l’équipe ESI et/ou de consultants spécialisés, de rencontres avec nos clients et leurs partenaires et par l’analyse des études déjà réalisées. Les projets sont évalués sur la base des réglementations nationales du pays et des normes et standards internationaux. Si des écarts sont constatés par rapport à ces normes et standards, des plans d’actions E&S sont développés par l’équipe ESI afin de maîtriser et gérer les risques identifiés et de promouvoir un développement durable des entreprises ou des institutions financières financées. \n",
      "Les plans d’actions E&S définissent les solutions conjointement approuvées par l’entreprise ou l’institution financière et Proparco pour améliorer la gestion E&S de l’entreprise et sa performance en la matière. Ils sont intégrés dans la documentation juridique et deviennent de fait des engagements contractuels.\n",
      "Pendant toute la durée du financement, la mise en œuvre des engagements des clients et l’évolution de leurs performances E&S font l’objet d’un suivi régulier par Proparco. \n",
      "Le suivi E&S est réalisé sur la base de rapports de suivi envoyés régulièrement par les clients, d’audits E&S menés par des consultants et de visites de site effectuées par les spécialistes de Proparco.\n",
      "Si nécessaire, le financement d’une assistance technique est proposé afin d’améliorer les capacités de nos clients, de les accompagner vers l’obtention de certifications, de définir des politiques de développement durable de l’entreprise, des systèmes de gestion des risques E&S des projets financés par les banques ou fonds d’investissement… \n",
      "Depuis plusieurs années, Proparco a harmonisé ses démarches et outils avec ses homologues européens , avec qui elle cofinance régulièrement des projets.\n",
      "Par devoir de redevabilité et souci de transparence, Proparco met en œuvre depuis 2006 une démarche de mesure des résultats et des impacts de ses financements. Les finalités de cette démarche sont, d’une part, de caractériser ces résultats et impacts des financements et, d’autre part, de préciser la contribution de Proparco à ce développement durable et inclusif des pays du Sud.\n",
      "Pour évaluer cette contribution et orienter efficacement ses investissements, Proparco utilise, lors de d’instruction et du suivi des projets, un outil de notation et de mesure et des indicateurs harmonisés avec l'AFD et ses homologues bailleurs de fonds.\n",
      "Selon la nature du client (entreprises, infrastructures, banques ou fonds d’investissement), Proparco évalue les effets du projet financé sur :\n",
      "les pratiques environnementales (réduction des émissions de GES, utilisation d’énergies renouvelables…), sociale (conditions d’emplois, hygiène et sécurité des travailleurs…) et de gouvernance des contreparties ;\n",
      "Lorsque la demande de financement concerne une institution financière, Proparco évalue également sa contribution à la bancarisation des populations ou à la diversification de l’allocation de crédits en faveur de secteurs et/ou d’acteurs clés pour le développement (produits de microfinance, PME, jeunes entreprises…).\n",
      "Pour les projets d’infrastructures, Proparco évalue la fiabilité et la sécurité des technologies employées, la contribution des projets au désenclavement d’une région (la fourniture d’électricité ou d’eau par exemple)...\n",
      "La notation peut être majorée si le projet favorise l’innovation (technique ou sociale), appuie une politique publique de développement, contribue à attirer des investissements additionnels dans le pays ou permet d’atteindre des populations isolées.\n",
      "Chaque année, Proparco consolide les résultats des opérations signée afin d'avoir une vision globale de son activité.\n",
      "Le suivi et l’évaluation des opérations financées par Proparco sont essentiels à l’efficacité de son action. Ils permettent en effet d’éprouver les hypothèses qui ont motivé le financement (nombre d’emplois créés, émissions de GES évitées, etc.), d’affiner ses stratégies sectorielles et géographiques, et, plus largement, de rendre compte de son activité.\n",
      "Pour chaque projet, un suivi annuel de l’évolution de certains indicateurs est réalisé d'après les données fournies par les clients de Proparco : ces reporting compilent, selon les secteurs d’activité, des données concernant l'emploi (direct et indirect), le nombre de femmes dans l’entreprise, les émissions de CO2 évitées, le montant des impôts sur les sociétés payés… \n",
      "Une évaluation ex post plus approfondie est réalisée pour certains projets ou groupe de projets par l'équipe ESI ou avec l'appui de consultants.\n",
      "Ces deux types d'« exercices » permettent de comparer les résultats avérés des projets aux résultats attendus au moment de la signature. Les étuides ex post permettent également de favoriser les apprentissages et d'alimenter la réflexion stratégique de Proparco.\n",
      "Pour compléter cette démarche, Proparco a adopté avec d’autres institutions financières de développement, une série d’indicateurs harmonisés pour reporter de façon homogène sur ses résultats de développement.\n",
      "Promouvoir la bonne gouvernance des sociétés financées par Proparco constitue une préoccupation majeure – au même titre que l’amélioration de leurs pratiques environnementales et sociales.\n",
      "L’équilibre des pouvoirs, l’efficacité du conseil d’administration, l’existence et le respect d’un code d’éthique, la rigueur des procédures de contrôle ou encore la transparence de l’information financière et non financière sont autant d’indicateurs reflétant la qualité de la gouvernance d’une société. La bonne gouvernance est une condition essentielle de la pérennité et du développement de l’entreprise. Elle est un facteur majeur de maîtrise des risques, d’accroissement de la valeur de l’entreprise et contribue à attirer les investisseurs.\n",
      "C’est pourquoi la promotion de bonnes pratiques de gouvernance fait partie intégrante des objectifs de développement durable de Proparco.\n",
      "Depuis 2011, Proparco s’est engagée avec 34 institutions financières de développement (IFD) à systématiser l’évaluation de la gouvernance des sociétés dans lesquelles elle prend une participation.Cette démarche consiste à identifier et évaluer les risques de gouvernance, et à proposer des pistes d'amélioration. Elle porte sur cinq aspects :\n",
      "l’engagement des instances de direction et de décision en faveur des principes de bonne gouvernance ; la pérennisation des entreprises familiales en assurant le passage de témoin aux nouvelles générations ;\n",
      "l'efficacité du conseil d’administration et les comités associés (composition, rôle réel, équilibrage entre membres indépendants et exécutifs...) ;\n",
      "En fonction des diagnostic réalisé, Proparco peut être amenée à appuyer son client dans la définition et la mise en œuvre d’actions clés pour améliorer sa gouvernance, éventuellement via une assistance technique. Un plan d’action est alors intégré à la documentation juridique et un suivi de sa mise en œuvre est réalisé régulièrement.\n",
      "La corruption, la fraude, le blanchiment de capitaux, le financement du terrorisme, les pratiques anti-concurrentielles, ainsi que toute forme de détournement des financements alloués au secteur privé par Proparco peuvent durablement porter atteinte au groupe AFD, en entachant sa crédibilité, sa légitimité et en diminuant la portée de ses financements\n",
      "Pour palier ce risque, le groupe AFD s’est doté d’un corps de procédures parmi les plus exigeants au sein des bailleurs de fonds, qui lui permet de s’assurer de la bonne allocation des prêts et garanties qu’il accorde\n",
      "Proparco porte également la plus grande vigilance à la réputation et la gouvernance des sociétés dans lesquelles elle prend des participations, y compris via les fonds d’investissement .\n",
      "En tant que filiale d’un établissement public, Proparco inscrit son action en conformité avec les politiques nationales de lutte contre les paradis fiscaux.\n",
      "Le groupe AFD dispose d’une politique rigoureuse et spécifique à l’égard des opérations réalisées et des projets financées dans les juridictions non-coopératives (JNC) au sens du Code général des impôts et du Forum mondial de l’OCDE sur la transparence et l’échange de renseignements à des fins fiscales.\n",
      "Ce dispositif de sécurité financière de Proparco participe également à la promotion des bonnes pratiques en matière de lutte contre la corruption dans ses pays d’intervention. Il s’applique à toutes les étapes : lors de l’instruction et, de façon régulière, tout au long de la vie du projet.\n",
      "Enfin, en tant qu’établissement bancaire, Proparco est soumis au secret bancaire qui relève en France du secret professionnel. Cette obligation lui interdit de communiquer des informations sur ses clients à des tiers, sans leur consentement, à l’exception des administrations autorisées.\n",
      "Proparco s’est dotée d’un dispositif visant à rendre publiques des informations sur son fonctionnement et son activité. Il permettra aux parties intéressées de mieux comprendre la vision, les missions et l’action de l’institution. Cette démarche s’inscrit dans le cadre de la politique de transparence du groupe AFD.\n",
      "La carte interactive des projets donne accès à des fiches d’information détaillées sur les opérations de Proparco dans le respect de ses obligations légales en matière de secret bancaire. Elle couvre l’ensemble des projets signés depuis le 1er janvier 2014 et pour lesquels un accord de diffusion du client a été obtenu, ainsi que quelques projets antérieurs (2005-2013), soit plus de 200 projets à ce jour. Les fiches sur les nouvelles opérations sont systématiquement intégrées à la carte sous réserve de l’autorisation des clients.\n",
      "Le centre de téléchargements donne accès à des informations relatives à la stratégie, au fonctionnement et à l’activité globale de Proparco. Il permet notamment le téléchargement de documents institutionnels (périmètre géographique, organigramme, etc.), sur la gouvernance de Proparco (règlement intérieur, statuts, composition du comité d’investissement consultatif et de son conseil d’administration) et de FISEA, sur les stratégies globales et sectorielles, sur les politiques de Proparco et du Groupe, et sur sa production intellectuelle.\n"

      "The task of the Swiss Investment Fund for Emerging Markets (SIFEM) is to promote long-term, sustainable and broad-based growth in developing and emerging countries. This is achieved by providing financial support to assist the growth of commercially viable small, medium and fast-growing companies. The company is able to create new jobs. A regular income helps to reduce poverty and alleviate migratory pressure. A strong private sector in turn generates taxes which allow the government to make investments in public infrastructures and social welfare.\n",

However, obtaining the necessary financing for their growth is a tremendous challenge for small, medium-sized and fast-growing companies. Local banks will only lend to a limited extent and will usually require personal guarantees. Access to the capital market remains largely barred to SMEs.\n",

      "TB remains a leading cause of death from infectious disease worldwide, with 10.4 million new cases reported in 2016.\n",
      "We are working to better understand the basic science behind the TB epidemic and support new tools for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, as well as the optimal delivery of TB care.\n",
      "Over the past two decades, the world has made significant progress in the fight against tuberculosis (TB). Between 1990 and 2014, TB mortality fell by 47 percent, and 66 million TB patients were successfully treated between 1995 and 2014 thanks to coordinated global efforts and the use of the recommended treatment, the directly observed therapy short-course (DOTS) strategy. Of those patients, 8 million people were also treated for HIV co-infection.\n",
      "While effective diagnosis and treatment has saved millions of lives, TB remains the leading cause of death from infectious disease worldwide. In 2016, an estimated 10.4 million new cases were reported, and nearly 1.7 million people died from the disease.\n",
      "In recent years, drug-resistant strains of TB have created a growing sense of urgency to control the spread of the disease. Two strains have emerged: multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), a form that is resistant to first-line drugs, and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB), which is also resistant to some second-line drugs. MDR-TB has appeared in nearly every country, with an estimated 490,000 new cases in 2016. These forms of the disease are difficult and costly to treat, and many drug-resistant cases are the result of systematic inadequate diagnosis and treatment. The TB epidemic has also accelerated in concert with HIV: In 2016, about 375,000 people died from TB/HIV co-infection.\n",
      "Current approaches to preventing, diagnosing, and treating TB are inadequate. The vaccine used today, Bacillius Calmette-Guerin (BCG), protects young children against severe forms of TB. However, BCG offers limited protection against pulmonary TB in adults, which is the most common form of the disease. The most commonly used diagnostic method, microscopic detection of bacteria from sputum, identifies only half of all cases. It also requires special skills and is labor-intensive. Even the standardized DOTS treatment regimen, despite significant success, has inherent challenges: With DOTS, patients must take a complex combination of pills every day for six months, with a health-care worker supervising the full treatment. The current regimen also has significant side effects. Many patients are unable to stay on treatment sufficiently to be cured.\n",
      "As a result of these issues, current TB care and treatment programs identify, diagnose, and successfully treat only around 50 percent of all patients with active TB disease.\n",
      "Over the past decade, innovative new tools and delivery strategies have reduced deaths from TB and improved the quality of patient care. But we urgently need more investments and greater collaboration to accelerate progress in treatment delivery and expand the pipeline of safe, effective drug and vaccine candidates.\n",
      "A more effective vaccine would be the single most powerful tool to reduce the incidence of TB. Even a partially effective new vaccine introduced in 2024 could, by some projections, decrease TB incidence by up to 70 percent by 2050.\n",
      "While the development of a better vaccine continues, we need tools we can start using now to interrupt the TB epidemic in the short and medium term. New ways to use existing tools to identify patients early, link them to care, and facilitate faster and more effective treatment will help reduce the burden of TB. Improved diagnostic tools will reduce delays in starting treatment. A simpler, safer, shorter, and more affordable drug regimen will improve treatment success rates.\n",
      "The field of TB also needs more funding. The drugs and diagnostics currently in clinical development can reach the people who need them most only if they are affordable and can be deployed efficiently. We need substantial financial resources for research and development, and investments from developed and TB-endemic countries, pharmaceutical companies, and foundations must be sustained.\n",
      "The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation’s strategy aims address the key gaps on the patient pathway to care through new approaches to protect against infection, prevent progression from infection to disease, and improve TB diagnosis and treatment. Our portfolio of work is diversified based on the understanding that vaccines, diagnostics, drugs, and improved care delivery are all essential to address the epidemic.\n",
      "Our efforts to develop a treatment regimen that is safer, shorter, simpler, and more affordable begin with the TB Drug Accelerator (TBDA) program, which aims to identify new drugs that work differently than existing drugs to kill bacteria. The program has developed new tools for drug discovery, and by bringing together academic and industry partners in a unique collaboration, it facilitates the sharing of best practices, methods, and data.\n",
      "The bacteria that causes TB can rapidly develop resistance to a single drug, so treatment always requires a combination of drugs. Because of conventional drug development requirements, however, developing more effective TB regimens can take decades. Currently, new TB drugs must be evaluated separately in clinical trials, and new drugs can be tested in combination only after individual approval.\n",
      "To address this obstacle, we have joined with partners to create the Critical Path to TB Drug Regimens (CPTR) initiative, which brings together leading international pharmaceutical companies, public health experts, NGOs, and U.S. and other regulatory authorities. CPTR aims to identify new pathways to regulatory approval and expedite testing of promising TB drug candidates in combination.\n",
      "We are currently co-funding multiple drug trials, with the goal of achieving an effective, short, and simple treatment regimen for all forms of TB, including drug-resistant TB. In the near term, the new regimens will benefit those with XDR-TB and MDR-TB, while providing important safety data and insights that will ultimately help us expand our efforts to patients with drug-sensitive TB. This will help us achieve our goal of a universal drug regimen.\n",
      "Of the estimated 10.4 million new cases of TB worldwide each year, more than 4 million people are undiagnosed and/or unreported. We are developing less expensive, more effective diagnostic tools that can reach more people with TB. We also support the development of communications systems that help more people access appropriate treatment and care.\n",
      "One new technology we helped fund, the GeneXpert diagnostic test, has led to an increase in overall TB case finding and has the potential to more effectively guide proper treatment. It better detects drug-resistant cases of TB from  sputum samples, helping providers select the most appropriate treatment.\n",
      "We are currently working on next-generation TB diagnostic tests based on samples that are easier to obtain than sputum, including blood, urine, and potentially even breath or sweat. While these techniques are in the early stages of development, we remain committed and optimistic that they will markedly improve TB detection, facilitate faster treatment, and reduce transmission.\n",
      "BCG, the only available TB vaccine, was developed almost 100 years ago and has limited efficacy after childhood. We need a more effective option to accelerate TB prevention.\n",
      "We work with multiple partners to better understand how to protect people against TB with a vaccine, with a focus on how the immune system responds to new vaccines. This requires lengthy, costly trials because mechanisms of TB protection are poorly understood and there are no known biomarkers that can predict how well a vaccine candidate will work.\n",
      "We established the Collaboration for TB Vaccine Discovery to facilitate the exchange of ideas among TB scientists. The group develops guidelines for safely and effectively progressing vaccine candidates through clinical trials, even as questions remain about early signs of efficacy. Among vaccine candidates currently supported in preclinical development, a cytomegalovirus (CMV)-based vaccine has shown the best protection in animal models.\n",
      "In India and China, we partner with governments to pilot innovative approaches to modernize TB control. With the government of India, the World Health Organization (WHO), USAID, and the World Bank, we are expanding TB-control efforts into the private health care sector, where most patients seek care. This includes an information and communications technology system to track patients throughout their course of treatment. In China, we have supported the government’s shift to hospital-led TB care, which increases referrals while maintaining a high standard of treatment. This model is being scaled up by national health authorities in cities and provinces across the country.\n",
      "Employees at a call center in Patna, India remind TB patients to take their medication, answer any questions and monitor treatment progress through the Universal Access to TB Care program.\n",
      "We have recently begun to expand our efforts in South Africa, where the new TB Think Tank provides evidence-based policy recommendations to the National Department of Health. We are also supporting an initiative to link health system databases to improve the monitoring of patients and programs.\n",
      "We are expanding all of our efforts through partnerships such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria; WHO; and UNITAID that maximize the impact of resources and investments. We support the use of data and analytics to drive policy and funding decisions globally and at the national level. We are also supporting the use of adherence technologies that will help patients complete treatment and increase their probability of a cure.\n",
      "We advocate for greater political commitment and funding to fight TB, particularly for research and development of new tools. We believe that strengthening partnerships with donor governments and multinational institutions, the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, and governments of TB-endemic countries is critical to fighting the disease. These partnerships can lead to greater investments in research and development as well as in the delivery of existing and new tools.\n",

      "We work to expand access to and improve prevention, diagnosis, and treatment approaches; develop new prevention tools; and advocate for needed resources and policy changes.\n",
      "Our HIV strategy is led by Emilio Emini, director, and is part of the foundation’s Global Health Division.\n",
      "Nearly 37 million people around the globe are living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and nearly as many people have died from HIV-related complications since the earliest cases were detected in the 1980s. Sub-Saharan Africa is the hardest-hit region, with more than 70 percent of the world’s people living with HIV. \n",
      "While substantial progress has been made in increasing access to HIV treatment and new cases of HIV have declined substantially in some regions, controlling the epidemic will require improved efforts to increase the number of people living with HIV who know their status, as well as the effective use of better treatment and prevention measures.\n",
      "Sub-Saharan Africa has an estimated 1.2 million new infections per year at a time when young people account for a significant and rapidly growing percentage of the population. As these young people reach the age of highest risk for HIV, a rebound in the epidemic may be inevitable unless efforts to combat the infection are greatly enhanced.\n",
      "In the past decade, the world has made significant progress in the fight against HIV due to large-scale treatment programs and efforts to prevent infection among infants born to mothers with HIV. The global incidence of HIV has declined by nearly 40 percent since 2001, and 17 million people worldwide are receiving antiretroviral treatment.\n",
      "Countries and global partners can continue to accelerate progress by sustaining their investments to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of HIV prevention and treatment programs and support research into new and better prevention methods.\n",
      "The goal of our program is to accelerate the decline in HIV infection worldwide and save lives by ensuring expanded and simplified HIV treatment and improved and effective use of interventions to prevent new infections.\n",

      "We focus our efforts in some of the hardest-hit countries of Sub-Saharan Africa and among key populations that are at greatest risk of infection. To date, we have committed more than US$3 billion in HIV grants to organizations around the world and more than US$1.6 billion to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. \n",
      "Because our resources represent only a small portion of worldwide funding to combat HIV, we concentrate on areas where existing funds are insufficient, our support can have potentially catalytic impact, and we can assume risks that others may not be able to.\n",
      "In each of our areas of focus, we work with an array of partners, including government agencies in high-burden and donor countries, multilateral organizations, nongovernmental organizations, academic institutions, community organizations, and private industry. We also work to ensure that adequate funding and appropriate global and national-level policies are in place to support HIV prevention and treatment efforts, research and development, and efforts to understand the motivations and needs of high-risk populations. \n",
      "About half of all people living with HIV, particularly men, do not know they have the virus. We support the development and appropriate use of novel tools that can greatly increase the number of people who know their status and who seek treatment. \n",
      "HIV treatment programs are often expensive and inflexible, leading many individuals living with HIV to discontinue the treatment they need. We support partners who are working to simplify the delivery of HIV treatment and introduce models of care that are more tailored to the needs of particular populations and their circumstances. Better patient data systems are also crucial to keeping people living with HIV on effective treatment.\n",

We support the improved use of viral load testing, as well as the development of novel virus load-testing systems, as a means of sustaining effective treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several existing measures have proven effective in preventing HIV infection. They include voluntary medical male circumcision, condoms, and drugs that reduce the risk of acquiring the virus after exposure. These measures can be effective only if they are affordable and reach high-risk populations—and only if those populations are aware of their risk of contracting HIV.\n",
      "Widespread voluntary medical male circumcision could play a major role in limiting the spread of HIV, and efforts by global partners have greatly improved access to and demand for circumcision. We support circumcision-related efforts in several high-burden countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n",
      "We also support efforts to improve consistent condom use and the use of drugs that reduce the risk of contracting HIV. In addition, understanding and addressing the obstacles to accessing and using these measures among high-risk populations is central to our overall prevention strategy. \n",
      "New, more effective prevention methods are essential to reducing HIV transmission. We support efforts to develop, evaluate, and introduce innovative approaches to protecting those at risk. These include potential long-acting prevention interventions that can provide continuous protection over a period of time. \n",
      "We continue to invest in efforts to develop an HIV vaccine. Although developing a highly effective vaccine remains a substantial scientific challenge, even a vaccine with partial efficacy and limited duration could help dramatically reduce the global incidence of HIV. \n",

      "Access to family planning information and contraceptives can change lives. Every woman and girl deserves the chance to determine her own future. Read women’s stories here.\n",
      "More than 220 million women in developing countries who don’t want to get pregnant lack access to contraceptives and voluntary family planning information and services.\n",
      "Rates of contraceptive use in some of the poorest countries have stalled, with less than 20 percent of women in Sub-Saharan Africa and barely one-third of women in South Asia using modern contraceptives.\n",
      "Increasing access to contraceptives and family planning information and services will result in fewer women and girls dying in pregnancy and childbirth, fewer unintended pregnancies, fewer abortions, and fewer infant deaths. \n",
      "We work to increase funding and improve policies for family planning, expand the demand for and use of contraceptives, develop innovative contraceptive technologies, and build evidence to improve service delivery. \n",
      "Our Family Planning program is led by Kellie Sloan, director, and is part of the foundation’s Global Development Division.\n",
      "Voluntary family planning is one of the great public health advances of the past century. Enabling women to make informed decisions about whether and when to have children reduces unintended pregnancies as well as maternal and newborn deaths. It also increases educational and economic opportunities for women and leads to healthier families and communities. Family planning is a smart, sensible, and vital component of global health and development.\n",
      "However, more than 220 million women in developing countries who don’t want to get pregnant lack access to contraceptives and voluntary family planning information and services. Less than 20 percent of women in Sub-Saharan Africa and barely one-third of women in South Asia use modern contraceptives. In 2012, an estimated 80 million women in developing countries had an unintended pregnancy; of those women, at least one in four resorted to an unsafe abortion.\n",
      "Significant challenges stand in the way of making contraceptives more widely available and accessible, including insufficient donor and developing country funding, lack of appropriate products that meet users’ needs, weak distribution systems, lack of reliable monitoring and data collection mechanisms, and cultural and knowledge barriers.\n",
      "Voluntary family planning is one of the most cost-effective investments a country can make in its future. Every dollar spent on family planning can save governments up to 6 dollars that can be spent on improving health, housing, water, sanitation, and other public services.\n",
      "In 2012, the landmark London Summit on Family Planning mobilized governments, international agencies, civil society organizations, foundations, and the private sector to commit to dramatically expanding access to voluntary family planning. The resulting global partnership, called Family Planning 2020 (FP2020), has created global momentum on the issue of access to contraceptives and has spurred collaboration, innovation, and greater accountability in family planning efforts.\n",
      "The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation’s Family Planning program is working to bring access to high-quality contraceptive information, services, and supplies to an additional 120 million women and girls in the poorest countries by 2020 without coercion or discrimination, with the longer-term goal of universal access to voluntary family planning.\n",
      "With our partners, we support national governments that have committed to the goals of FP2020 and are leading the development and implementation of their own country-specific plans.\n",
      "Foundation support includes assessing family planning needs, particularly among the poorest and most vulnerable populations; identifying access barriers and funding gaps; developing and testing interventions; sharing evidence-based practices; promoting accountability through real-time performance monitoring and data collection; and fostering coordination among governments, partners, and donors.\n",
      "We also work to increase funding and improve policies for family planning, create public-private partnerships to expand contraceptive access and options, develop innovative and affordable contraceptive technologies, and support further research to close knowledge gaps.\n",
      "We are particularly committed to exploring how our family planning efforts can meet the needs of young women and girls.\n",
      "We work with countries that are committed to expanding access to high-quality, voluntary family planning to reduce maternal and newborn mortality. Our deepest engagements are in India and Nigeria.

      "We work to keep family planning on the global agenda and to hold donors and developing countries accountable for their commitments to support family planning. Our work in this area includes grantmaking, direct advocacy, communications counsel and support, and engagement with leaders.\n",
      "To monitor changes in contraceptive use and help all FP2020 countries track annual progress toward their goals and improve program performance, we are investing in rapid surveys that will provide data on family planning use in 6- and 12-month intervals, supplementing country-wide health surveys that provide data only every 3 to 5 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are also leading the effort to harmonize the way various organizations track family planning resources. The new data systems will use standard metrics and provide reliable data at the national and sub-national levels. Better data and monitoring are crucial to holding donors, governments, programs, and providers accountable.\n",
      "Better service delivery is critical to expanding access to and use of contraceptives, particularly in the poorest countries with the weakest health service infrastructure. We build evidence about what works to address supply and demand barriers on a large scale and in multiple countries, promote collaboration between the public and private sectors on delivery solutions, and synthesize and communicate research findings to donors, countries, and partners.\n",
      "Some women do not access or use contraceptives for a variety of reasons, even when they want to avoid pregnancy. They may have misconceptions about their risk of becoming pregnant, or be deterred by the cost, inconvenience, or concerns about side effects. In some cases, opposition from family members or a limited range of available methods can be a key factor in non use. \n",
      "Less than 20 percent of women in Sub-Saharan Africa and barely one-third of women in South Asia use modern contraceptives.\n",
      "Continued innovation in contraceptive technology is needed to address these barriers and meet the demands of women in different circumstances and at different stages of their lives. We support the discovery, development, and distribution of new technologies that address reasons for non-use, with a focus on improving acceptance and continued use among priority user groups: women who have achieved their desired family size, women who are not using an existing methods due to side effects, and young women.  These long-term investments will address contraceptive needs far beyond 2020 and will also include collaboration with the foundation’s HIV program to develop new technologies that prevent both pregnancy and HIV acquisition.\n",

      "Malaria occurs in nearly 100 countries worldwide. According to the 2013 World Malaria Report, there were more than 200 million malaria cases in 2012. An estimated 627,000 people died from malaria in 2012, 90 percent of them in Sub-Saharan Africa. Most of those who die from malaria are children under age 5.\n",
      "Between 2000 and 2012, major investments in diagnosis, treatment, and prevention contributed to a 25 percent decline in malaria incidence and a 42 percent decline in malaria deaths worldwide.\n",
      "Despite significant progress, current tools and treatments are insufficient to eliminate malaria in many countries because of challenges such as growing insecticide and drug resistance and continued transmission by people who are infected but asymptomatic.\n",
      "The only sustainable approach to addressing malaria is eradication of the parasite. Donor countries cannot maintain funding of several billion dollars a year in perpetuity, and a resurgence of malaria could threaten hard-won progress. Eradication of malaria is biologically and technically feasible, with sufficient global commitment and major investments in transformative new tools and delivery strategies.\n",
      "Malaria occurs in nearly 100 countries worldwide, exacting a huge toll on human health and imposing a heavy social and economic burden in developing countries, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. An estimated 207 million people suffered from the disease in 2012, and about 627,000 died. About 90 percent of the deaths were in Sub-Saharan Africa, and 77 percent were among children under age 5.\n",
      "Malaria is caused by parasites transmitted by mosquitoes. Even in relatively mild cases, it can cause high fever, chills, flu-like symptoms, and severe anemia. These symptoms can be especially dangerous for pregnant women and young children who are experiencing the disease for the first time. Severe malaria can cause lifelong intellectual disabilities in children, and malaria’s economic impact is estimated to cost billions of dollars in lost productivity every year.\n",
      "In the past dozen years, malaria funding has increased nearly 10-fold and major gains have been made in controlling the disease in developing nations. The number of new cases has declined by 25 percent globally, and deaths from malaria have fallen by 42 percent. These gains have been made through a combination of interventions, including timely diagnosis and treatment using reliable diagnostic tests and effective drugs; indoor spraying with safe, long-lasting insecticides; and the use of bed nets treated with long-lasting insecticide to protect people from mosquito bites at night.\n",
      "Current tools and treatments are insufficient, however, to achieve elimination in many countries. And the cost of maintaining these interventions has reached several billion dollars a year. The malaria parasite has begun to develop resistance to currently available insecticides and drugs, and these resistant strains will spread. Infected individuals who are asymptomatic—the majority of those infected—remain an ongoing source of transmission.\n",
      "Given sufficient global commitment, major investments in research and development, and transformative new tools and delivery strategies, the ambitious goal of malaria eradication can be met. Without an immediate, coordinated worldwide effort to eradicate malaria, this window of opportunity could close indefinitely and the progress already achieved will remain at risk.\n",
      "Malaria is preventable and treatable, and history shows that it can be eliminated. Less than a century ago, it was prevalent across the world, including Europe and North America. Malaria was eliminated in most of Western Europe by the mid-1930s; the United States achieved elimination of the disease in 1951. \n",
      "We have the opportunity to accelerate progress toward elimination in all countries by improving the delivery of existing interventions as well as developing new tools and new strategies that target not just malaria-transmitting mosquitoes but also the parasite itself, which can survive in humans for more than 10 years. By mobilizing the required commitment and resources, we can achieve global eradication and save many millions of lives.\n",
      "Malaria is a top priority of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Our new multi-year Malaria strategy, Accelerate to Zero, adopted in late 2013, addresses the areas in which we believe the foundation is best positioned, among a broad spectrum of partners, to develop groundbreaking approaches to reducing the burden of malaria and accelerating progress toward eradication of the disease. \n",
      "Our Malaria strategy is based on a core set of foundational principles that support our evolving strategic choices.\n",
      "We concentrate our resources in areas where we can identify significant leverage points, and we assume risks that are more challenging for others to take. \n",
      "Potentially transformative measures that could accelerate malaria eradication include single-dose treatments that are safe and well tolerated, highly sensitive diagnostic tests, and vaccines that prevent infection or block transmission.\n",
      "Because emerging resistance to insecticides and drugs is the most important biologic threat to the goal of eradication, we are investing in the development of new tools and strategies to prevent or delay resistance.\n",
      "To date, we have committed nearly US$2 billion in grants to combat malaria. In addition, we have committed more than US$1.6 billion to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, which provides about 50 percent of international funding for malaria control worldwide. We also advocate for sustained and increased funding of malaria-related efforts by donor governments and endemic countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are generating evidence that malaria can be eliminated in diverse geopolitical and transmission zones, including Southern Africa and the Greater Mekong Sub-region. We believe that current tools used more effectively or in novel ways, along with strong partnerships and government commitment, can bring malaria campaigns closer to the “last mile” of elimination. This includes improving the delivery of existing vector-control tools, diagnostics, and drugs; investigating the potential of existing drugs to achieve complete cure at the individual and population levels, including the asymptomatic reservoir; and refining strategies for reaching special populations, such as pregnant women and children under age 5. \n",
      "Because current tools are not sufficient to achieve global eradication, we are investing in a range of new interventions that have greater impact. We are working to develop transmission-blocking vaccines as well as a single, fixed-dose combination drug for complete cure and prevention. \n",
      "We invest in high-sensitivity diagnostic tools and real-time data transfer methods to better understand epidemiological patterns of infection. This can help lead to better surveillance strategies and more efficient and effective elimination campaigns. \n",
      "We are exploring new vector-control tools that address increasing resistance to insecticides that kill mosquitoes or prevent them from biting people.\n",
      "New and enhanced surveillance tools will be critical to moving from very low transmission to zero transmission and sustaining zero transmission, especially in remote areas and areas of conflict. In testing and implementing new surveillance tools and methods, we are learning from other eradication programs, such as those for smallpox and polio. We are also exploring new ways to measure progress and to document when elimination has been achieved.\n",
      "We work to ensure that malaria has a prominent place on the global agenda and garners the political support and resources needed for eventual eradication. Our work in this area includes supporting countries in their efforts to lower the malaria burden and scale up successful interventions, providing evidence to support the use of effective new measures, and advocating for national and global policies and funding to support effective malaria programs.\n",

      "Our Integrated Delivery strategy is led by Dana Hovig, director, and is part of the foundation’s Global Development Division.\n",
      "Efforts to prevent disease and improve health are often uncoordinated in the developing world. Even when life-saving drugs and diagnostic tools can be made affordable enough for poorer countries, they can take years to become widely available due to lack of efficient and effective delivery systems.\n",
      "Without a systematic effort to improve coordination and create shared delivery channels, health programs will remain fragmented and resources will be wasted on redundant systems. Country primary healthcare systems, which are the primary means of delivering health interventions in developing countries, also urgently need improvement. At the same time, opportunities for coordination across health and development sectors (between health and agriculture, for example) are underexploited.\n",
      "We largely know what to deliver and what solutions are “effective.” The international health and development sectors have developed best practices, life-saving interventions, and drugs and treatments that work when they are used in the right way and at the right time. However, less attention has been paid to performance management and achieving greater efficiency, productivity, and accountability in service delivery channels and health systems.\n",
      "Global partnerships and infrastructure have helped achieve major gains in vaccine coverage. The vaccine system has benefited from coordinated investments in products, launch capacity, and markets; delivery platforms that serve multiple programs across multiple geographies; and integration with country health systems that deliver essential health services. \n",
      "Drugs, diagnostics, and other interventions need the same kind of coordinated delivery and shared infrastructure—starting with product design, market research, launch planning, innovation introduction, and efforts to achieve large-scale coverage and impact. \n",
      "The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is an active funder of delivery programs in developing countries. Since 1999, we have invested US$7 billion in the delivery of non-vaccine health solutions, accounting for about 30 percent of all foundation grants to date. We anticipate maintaining our commitment to delivery in the future.\n",
      "However, like many of our partners in global health, we have realized that our delivery efforts for specific diseases and specific health products can lead to fragmentation. Unless we coordinate delivery efforts across our foundation programs, help strengthen entire country health systems, and help build integrated delivery channels that include both public and private-sector providers, we cannot achieve our ambitious global health and development goals.\n",
      "The Integrated Delivery team was established in 2012 with a mandate to enhance the impact of delivery investments made by the foundation’s various program teams in the health and development sectors. We provide technical support to those teams and their partners to help speed the delivery and improve the effectiveness of life-saving and life-improving interventions. We also make investments to improve delivery systems more broadly.\n",
      "\n",
      "We help foundation teams and their partners conduct market research and market testing so products and tools can be designed to meet user needs. We also help support the launch and distribution of those products, which range from contraceptive devices to HIV diagnostic tests, nutritional supplements, and tuberculosis drugs.\n",
      "One example is our work in helping to plan the introduction of a new diagnostic tool and new treatment for sleeping sickness (human African trypanosomiasis). The existing diagnostic method involves a painful procedure at a hospital, and the treatment is based on an arsenic compound, which causes terrible side effects and has a 5 percent death rate. A new diagnostic tool that the foundation is co-developing is pending approval and requires only a finger prick and no lab analysis. A new treatment that completely cures the disease with 10 pills in 10 days is also pending approval. The launch and targeted delivery of the new diagnostic tool and drug will make elimination of sleeping sickness feasible within our lifetimes.\n",
      "We support efforts to design and build delivery platforms that serve the needs of multiple programs across multiple geographies. We have identified five delivery platforms, or “public goods,” that we aim to strengthen.\n",
      "\n",
      "One example is our investment in improving child health in Burkina Faso by strengthening community health worker productivity and performance. The effort includes providing health workers with electronic devices to help them accurately identify childhood illnesses, increase their adherence to established treatment guidelines, and strengthen the ability of district health teams to use data to manage health workers and track their performance.\n",
      "People who live in countries with strong primary care systems are healthier overall. For the poorest people, the primary care system is their main source of healthcare. \n",
      "We invest in strengthening country healthcare systems that provide treatment, prevention, promotion, and other essential services. Our focus countries currently include Ethiopia, India (Bihar and Uttar Pradesh), and Nigeria. We take a “whole systems” approach that includes both the public and private sectors. We respect and honor the choices that people in low- and middle-income countries make in terms of where they seek health services, and we aim to strengthen the quality of public, private, nonprofit, and faith-based service providers.\n",
      "In India, for example, the foundation has invested in improving the performance management of the Bihar government’s primary care system via mobile training tools for community health workers; developing digital systems for recording patient data, tracking performance, managing and supervising health workers, and monitoring family planning and routine immunization coverage; and developing digital payment systems for healthcare. We also offer technical support to improve the quality of care and promote accountability. \n",

Tens of thousands of other children suffer from severe or permanently disabling illnesses.\n",
      "Vaccines are often expensive for the world’s poorest countries, and supply shortages and a lack of trained health workers are challenges as well. Unreliable transportation systems and storage facilities also make it difficult to preserve high-quality vaccines that require refrigeration.\n",
      "The Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP), endorsed by the 194 member states of the World Health Assembly (WHA) in 2012, provides a framework for achieving the vision of the Decade of Vaccines—delivering full access to immunization by 2020 and extending the full benefits of immunization to all people, regardless of where they are born, who they are, or where they live.\n",
      "The GVAP sets out strategic objectives, recommends actions and stakeholder responsibilities for achieving the objectives, and provides for monitoring and evaluation of the plan’s implementation. All WHA countries now report annually on progress against GVAP indicators.\n",
      "The plan was the result of a global collaboration involving governments and elected officials, health professionals, academic institutions, vaccine manufacturers, nongovernmental organizations, and civil society organizations.\n",
      "If the global community meets the plan’s objectives, childhood mortality around the world will be reduced below the targets set by the United Nations Millennium Development Goals.\n",
      "Global immunization coverage has never been higher. More than 100 million children are immunized each year against tuberculosis, polio, measles, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type B, and, in some countries, yellow fever. These vaccines save an estimated 2.5 million lives each year.\n",
      "Nearly 200 countries around the globe have endorsed a shared vision—known as the Decade of Vaccines—to extend the benefits of vaccines to every person by 2020 and thereby save more than 20 million lives. This international collaboration has generated the Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP), a framework for preventing millions of deaths by 2020 through more equitable access to existing vaccines for people in all communities. \n",
      "At the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, all of our investments in vaccines and immunization contribute to the goals of the Decade of Vaccines. As one entity within the greater vaccine community—which includes national governments, other donors, international organizations, the private sector, academia, civil society organizations, faith-based organizations, and local communities—we are working to ensure that existing life-saving vaccines are introduced into countries where people need them most and to support the innovation needed to develop new vaccines and new delivery technologies and approaches.\n",
      "Ultimately, all of our vaccine-related work depends on strong delivery systems within countries. We therefore invest in partners whose programs strengthen and provide support for country immunization systems. Our partners include civil society organizations, the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF, and the GAVI Alliance.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of our most important collaborations is with the GAVI Alliance, a global public-private partnership of scientists, health experts, government leaders, businesses, and philanthropic organizations whose goal is to save children’s lives and improve health through increased access to immunization in 73 of the world’s poorest countries. GAVI provides funding to buy vaccines for, and provide technical support to, countries with the greatest needs. Since 1999, the foundation has committed US$2.5 billion to GAVI.\n",
      "GAVI is helping countries introduce an array of vaccines, including vaccines against pneumococcal disease and rotavirus, the main causes of pneumonia and severe diarrhea, respectively. These are among the leading causes of child deaths in developing countries. GAVI also supports pilot projects to plan for the introduction of the HPV vaccine, which helps protect against cervical cancer, a leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women in developing countries.\n",
      "In addition to our commitments to GAVI, we make direct investments with partners in India, Nigeria, and Ethiopia, which together account for a significant proportion of the world’s unvaccinated and undervaccinated children and where we have strong relationships with governments and a wide range of other investments. \n",
      "Our efforts to support polio eradication are an integral part of our country-based approach in the remaining polio-endemic countries— Nigeria, Pakistan, and Afghanistan—as well as in countries that have experienced polio outbreaks.\n",
      "Health workers at a launch event for the MenAfriVac meningitis vaccine in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. (Photo © PATH / Gabriel Bienczycki)\n",
      "We work to strengthen country immunization systems by supporting the collection, analysis, and use of high-quality vaccine-related data, improving the measurement and evaluation of vaccination efforts, and developing new diagnostic tools to help health workers assess population immunity to disease.\n",
      "Another priority is strengthening vaccine-related supply chains and logistics. We support the development of new ways to help countries improve the storage, transportation, and distribution of vaccines. This is particularly crucial as countries prepare to deliver a greater volume of vaccines to a greater number of people. Many vaccines are temperature-sensitive and require special storage, transport, and handling to ensure that they maintain their potency.\n",
      "Workers at the Serum Institute of India, a major producer of affordable vaccines used in the developing world.\n",
      "In the area of routine immunization, we advocate for stronger, fully financed systems to deliver routine vaccines along with well-planned and well-run education campaigns.\n",
      "One example of how we work to strengthen immunization systems is in Bihar, India’s most densely populated state. We are building on successful efforts in Bihar to increase immunization coverage and are supporting programs to test and evaluate innovations such as technologies for vaccine registration, tracking, and mapping. We are also investing in new ways to generate demand for and awareness of immunizations among healthcare providers and families.\n",
      "To get the most promising new vaccines to the people who need them, we participate in innovative partnerships that span the continuum from discovery to development to delivery.\n",
      "For example, we supported a major partnership between PATH, WHO, the Serum Institute of India, and African governments to develop an affordable vaccine to prevent meningitis A. MenAfriVac is the first vaccine designed specifically for use in Africa, and within a year of its introduction it led to a dramatic drop in meningitis A infections. Promising vaccines to prevent malaria and dengue are currently in late-stage development and could have a major impact in the fight against those diseases.\n",
      "The first infant in India to receive a pentavalent vaccine introduced by the GAVI Alliance. (Photo © GAVI Alliance)\n",
      "We also invest in research and development to improve existing vaccines. Improvements include the use of new adjuvants that strengthen immune response and could reduce the amount of antigen needed per dose, thereby lowering the cost of immunizations. Other improvements reduce the number of doses required and make vaccines easier to administer. We also support research to simplify vaccine delivery through innovations such as needle-free delivery systems and heat-stabilized vaccines that don’t require refrigeration.\n",
      "Along with supply and demand, price is a critical element in the successful launch and sustainable use of any new vaccine. Without a clear idea of the demand for a vaccine and how it might be delivered, manufacturers have little incentive to invest in product development and manufacturing. We are addressing this challenge by working with private industry on innovative, market-based financing mechanisms to ensure that vaccines are developed at the lowest possible cost.\n",
      "We work at the international, national, and local levels to ensure that immunization remains a global health priority. We are committed to supporting and strengthening the GAVI Alliance and our other partners that work to improve and expand immunization.\n",

      "\t\t\tA physics lab at Central Piedmont Community College in Charlotte, North Carolina, which offers nearly 300 degree and certificate programs.\n",
      "\t\t\n",
      "A college education is the gateway to the American middle class, with college graduates earning as much as 65 percent more than those with only a high school education. But many who want to attend college cannot afford it.\n",
      "Poor college completion rates in the U.S. hurt the national economy. More than 40 percent of college students drop out before finishing or withdraw for a period of time.\n",
      "The cost of higher education continues to rise faster than any other cost in the United States, including healthcare, while state funding for student financial aid has steadily decreased.\n",
      "The foundation works with educators, researchers, technologists, foundations, policymakers, and other partners to help public colleges and universities affordably and efficiently guide more low-income students to degree completion.\n",
      "Our Postsecondary Success strategy is led by Daniel Greenstein, director, and is part of the foundation’s United States Division.\n",
      "Public higher education in the United States is at a watershed moment. As education costs rise and colleges and universities face growing financial pressures, the education gap is widening and public student financial aid systems are getting stretched to the limit—all of this at a time when our economy needs more college-educated workers than ever before.\n",
      "Left unabated, these trends will leave the U.S. economy without the skilled workforce it needs to remain competitive and will likely increase the education gap between those from low-income backgrounds and the rest of the population. Given the role that higher education has historically played as an engine of social mobility and economic growth, the political and social implications for our nation, and particularly for lower-income people, are profound and unacceptable. They are also avoidable.\n",
      "Research and practical experimentation at colleges and universities across the country are revealing promising solutions that could enable colleges and universities to increase graduation rates while maintaining or reducing costs and ensuring that all students receive a high-quality educational experience that is tailored to their needs, academic abilities, and career or employment goals.\n",
      "These solutions include sophisticated technology-enabled teaching and student advising tools, as well as enterprise-wide systems that gather and analyze data to help institutions improve their performance and student outcomes. Also vitally important is close alignment between high school graduation requirements and college entry standards.\n",
      "The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is committed to ensuring that all students have the opportunity to receive a high-quality education. We have two programs that work in concert toward this goal: College-Ready Education, which aims to ensure that all students graduate from high school prepared to succeed in college and in a career; and Postsecondary Success, whose goal is to dramatically increase the number of young people who obtain a postsecondary degree or certificate with labor-market value. Areas of intersection include practical approaches and policy strategies to better align K-12 standards—including the Common Core State Standards—with higher-education standards. \n",
      "Our Postsecondary Success strategy seeks to increase low-income students’ college completion rates through innovations that can improve the productivity and performance of U.S. universities and colleges and ensure that all students have access to a high-quality, highly personalized education.\n",
      "Our investments seek to accelerate efforts already under way in higher education and to support the enormous talent, creativity, and energy being applied to improving student completion rates and lowering costs while raising the quality of the U.S. postsecondary education system. \n",
      "Our primary approach is to play a catalytic role—to support the development of solutions that are unlikely to be generated by institutions working alone and that can trigger change on a broader scale. In each case, we work with our partners to build on the best of practitioner knowledge, available research, and analogous experiences in related sectors. We also rigorously evaluate these solutions in real-world settings, placing as much importance on effective implementation as on student outcomes.\n",
      "Our partners include highly innovative colleges and universities that are engaged in bold, systematic reform efforts. Their efforts allow us to understand how new tools and approaches can be integrated effectively at the institutional level, and they help us understand the interplay between institutional practice and state and national education policies and regulations. Some of our collaborators are wholly new entities launched in the past few years that are experimenting with groundbreaking new paradigms in higher education.\n",
      "Our investments aim to help U.S. higher education become more personalized, flexible, clear, and affordable. We are also working with institutions across the country that are committed to innovation and have the potential to become exemplars for other institutions that share their goals.\n",
      "The “typical” higher education student has changed. Nearly three out of four postsecondary students today are not enrolled in a full-time, four-year degree program. They are balancing jobs, family, and other priorities as they work to finish their studies. Because students learn best when education is targeted to their needs and goals, we are exploring how to use technology to help colleges and universities educate students more effectively, measure student understanding in real time, and respond to students’ needs. By integrating technology into online and hybrid courses and into student advising, colleges can support more students at a lower cost and with better learning outcomes.\n",
      "Foothill College in California’s Silicon Valley offers an innovative self-paced math program for students who need remedial instruction.\n",
      "We work with our partners to help students transition easily between high school and college, between colleges, and out of college into a sustainable career. These efforts include initiatives to align high school graduation and college-entry standards, improve placement testing, and develop remedial programs that help students quickly identify and close gaps in their high school education. We also support efforts to make course credits more easily transferable between colleges.\n",
      "We invest in better data collection about student achievement and institutional performance, which can help inform students’ college choices, provide prospective employers with measures of student attainment and skills, and help institutions and policymakers improve outcomes and manage costs. Our efforts in this area include support for the development of a national, student-level information system for reporting student outcomes.\n",
      "We are exploring new educational models that can deliver a high-quality, personalized education to more people at the same and at lower cost. We also support policies that focus financial aid programs on the neediest students and ensure that a postsecondary degree is affordable to everyone.\n",
      "We are working with institutions in key segments of higher education that are transforming their educational and business models to meet the needs of low-income and first-generation college students. We support their efforts with research and evaluation tools, help them share what they are learning, and connect them with other institutions that share their goals.\n",

      "\t\t\tA maize farmer in Tanzania whose crop yields have increased through the use of better seeds.\n",
      "\t\t\n",
      "Nearly 1 billion people worldwide are affected by severe hunger and poverty. Many are farmers who rely on small plots of land (about one to two acres) for their food and income. \n",
      "Our goal is to help these farming families produce more food and increase their income, while preserving the land for future generations.\n",
      "We focus on the crops and livestock that are most important to farming families in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.\n",
      "Helping women farmers is one of our top priorities because women do much of the agricultural work and their well-being affects the health, welfare, and education of their children.\n",
      "From the 1960s to 1980s, the “Green Revolution” in Asia and Latin America—a sweeping effort to transform farming methods and improve staple crops such as maize, wheat, and rice—helped to double food production and saved hundreds of millions of lives.\n",
      "Many governments and donors subsequently shifted their attention to other concerns, believing that the problem of inadequate food supply in the developing world had been solved. This was not the case in Sub-Saharan Africa, however, where some Green Revolution approaches were tried but failed.\n",
      "Meanwhile, in the intervening years, population growth, rising incomes, dwindling natural resources, and a changing climate have caused food prices to rise and agricultural productivity has once again become strained. \n",
      "Many of those affected are smallholder farmers. Three-quarters of the world’s poorest people get their food and income by farming small plots of land about the size of a football field. Most of them barely get by—struggling with unproductive soil, plant diseases, pests, and drought. Their livestock are frequently weak or sick. Reliable markets for their products and good information about pricing are hard to come by, and government policies rarely serve their interests well.\n",
      "These factors, in turn, put millions of families at risk for poverty and hunger as well as malnutrition—the world’s most serious health problem and the single biggest contributor to child mortality. At the same time, one consequence of the first Green Revolution—excessive fertilizer use leading to water pollution—underscores the importance of sustainability to safeguard both environmental and human health.\n",
      "Helping farming families increase production in a sustainable way, and sell more crops, is the most effective way to reduce hunger and poverty over the long term. \n",
      "Dairy farmers in Bangladesh are benefiting from programs that help them increase production and improve veterinary care.\n",
      "When farmers grow more food and earn more income, they are better able feed to their families, send their children to school, provide for their family’s health, and invest in their farms. This makes their communities economically stronger and more stable.\n",
      "Helping farmers improve their yields requires a comprehensive approach that includes the use of seeds that are more resistant to disease, drought, and flooding; information from trusted local sources about more productive farming techniques and technologies; greater access to markets; and government policies that serve the interests of farming families.\n",
      "Agricultural development must also address gender disparities. In Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, women are vital contributors to farm work, but because they have less access to improved seeds, better techniques and technologies, and markets, yields on their plots are typically 20 to 40 percent lower than on plots farmed by men. Addressing this gap can help households become more productive and reduce malnutrition within poor families.\n",
      "Agricultural Development is one of the largest initiatives of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. To date, we have committed more than US$2 billion to agricultural development efforts, primarily in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Our approach is based on the following principles:\n",
      "We invest in the following strategic areas that we believe will help address the challenges and local realities faced by farming families in the developing world. \n",
      "Researchers are seeking ways to combat crop disease such as those infecting the cassava plants on this Tanzania farm.\n",
      "We support research to develop more productive and nutritious varieties of the staple crops grown and consumed by farming families. These include varieties adapted to local conditions that deliver specific benefits farmers seek, such as increased yields, better nutrition, and tolerance to drought, flood, and pests. We fund research to discover ways to better manage soil and water resources and reduce crop loss due to spoilage, weeds, pests, disease, and other threats. \n",
      "Timely, relevant, and accurate information is crucial to farmers. Policymakers in developing countries also need good data to inform their decision making. We support data collection, research, and policy analysis to help evaluate the impact of various approaches, get accurate information to farmers, and assess the effects of national and international agricultural policies. Our research also includes measuring the progress of our grants to ensure that they are delivering the anticipated benefits to farming families.\n",
      "Livestock is a key part of farming in developing countries and is crucial to the livelihoods of more than 900 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. We support efforts to improve the health and productivity of livestock—particularly chickens, goats, and cows—by improving animal genetics and veterinary care. To ensure that farmers can benefit from animal health and genetics technologies, we test models for providing farmers with the knowledge and tools they need to increase their on-farm production and connect to stable markets. Our work particularly aims to increase income-generating opportunities for women, who may have little control over productive resources such as land but sometimes own and control livestock, especially poultry and goats.\n",
      "We support efforts to get new and appropriate tools and farming practices into the hands of farmers. This includes improved seeds and access to better soil, water, and livestock solutions. We look for ways to strengthen knowledge exchange through technologies such as mobile phones and radio. We also work with farmers’ organizations to help farmers hone their business management skills, gain greater purchasing power and marketing leverage, and improve their crop and resource management skills. Additional priorities include helping farmers improve their storage and post-harvest activities, meet quality and quantity commitments, link to large-scale and reliable markets, and establish partnerships with buyers, processors, and farmers’ organizations.\n",
      "To achieve the goal of sustainable agricultural productivity, our strategy relies on strong partnerships with donor countries, multilateral institutions, private foundations, and other organizations. While strengthening existing partnerships, we are building new partnerships with countries such as Brazil and China, which have developed their own agricultural sectors through technological and policy innovation and are increasingly important to agricultural growth in the regions where we work. Through our advocacy efforts and investments, we seek innovative solutions to agricultural policy challenges and we work to foster the political will and public support to solve them. Our overall goal is to ensure that donor and developing-country investments and policies support sustainable smallholder farmer productivity.\n",

      "The world’s 320,000 public libraries are uniquely positioned to offer access to information and technology because they are safe and trusted places with trained staff, existing infrastructure, and public financial support.\n",

      "Our Global Libraries strategy is led by Deborah Jacobs, director, and is part of our Global Development Division.\n",
      "In an age where economic, educational, health, and social opportunities increasingly depend on access to the Internet, lack of access means lack of opportunity. Only 35 percent of the world’s population is connected to the Internet, and people in rural and poor communities are the least likely to have online access or the skills to navigate the digital world. Through the Internet, people search for employment, find markets for their crops and products, access government programs, learn new skills through online courses, research important health issues, and engage in social interactions with distant family members and friends.\n",
      "Opportunities available online have become so important to individual and community development that a 2011 report to the United Nations Human Rights Council by the Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression declared Internet access to be a fundamental enabler of human rights. Several national governments, including those of Costa Rica, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, and Spain, have formally recognized Internet access as a human right that allows citizens to stay informed and use the information and online services needed in 21st-century life.\n",
      "Equality of opportunity in the digital age requires that all individuals, especially those living in rural and poor communities, have access to online information along with the skills to use and interpret the information they find on the Internet. Worldwide, public libraries are uniquely positioned to provide this opportunity.\n",
      "Most countries have public libraries. There are more than 320,000 libraries worldwide, 73 percent of them in developing and transitioning countries. In many communities, public libraries are the only place where any person, regardless of education or skill level, can have access to information and the Internet free of charge. Moreover, library staff often provide training and support for first-time Internet users as well as those looking to improve their skills.\n",
      "As vital as they are, however, public libraries are often underutilized and need critical support to move forward into the digital age. Meeting the evolving information needs of individuals and communities through technology is no easy task. Technology becomes obsolete quickly, and resources are needed to keep up with ever-changing community needs.\n",
      "With their existing infrastructure, dedicated staff, and mission to connect individuals to information, libraries are uniquely suited to offering public Internet access and training to people who would otherwise be left behind in the digital world. \n",
      "If libraries can reinvent themselves and embrace their role as online information centers, the impact on individuals and communities will be significant. Public libraries are already teaching farmers and fishermen to use the Internet to promote their products and get current market prices. Families and individuals are using technology in libraries to access information on maternal health, early childhood development and nutrition, and HIV/AIDS. Library users are going online to learn about farming methods and ways to address climate change and deforestation.\n",
      "In the United States, about a third of those age 14 and older—roughly 77 million people—use a public library computer or wireless network to access the Internet each year. A recent study showed that library users tend to access more information about health, government, language, and culture than those who use the Internet at other public locations. Public library users also report more positive impact on their lives from Internet use in areas such as health, education, time savings, income, and personal finances. \n",
      "In Chile, a national digital literacy campaign trained hundreds of thousands of people in basic technology skills, largely via a network of more than 300 public libraries. In Mexico, public libraries provide the only Internet access for nearly two-thirds of rural communities. In rural Botswana, public libraries serve as small business owners’ offices, helping people make their businesses more sophisticated and competitive. In Ukraine, one community has used library Internet access to collect information about farming techniques, fundamentally changing the way they grow tomatoes and substantially increasing their crop quality and yield.\n",
      "As these examples show, access to information and knowledge is a great equalizer. It enriches lives, informs choices, and prepares people for meaningful employment and contribution to their communities. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation’s first grants, made in 1997, funded free Internet access in U.S. public libraries as a way to give all people ready access to information and the opportunities that come with digital skills and connectivity. As the foundation’s work has expanded globally, so has our library initiative. Since 2002, we have built on our experience in bringing Internet connectivity to U.S. public libraries to support similar efforts worldwide.\n",
      "Our Global Libraries program works to support the transformation of libraries as engines of development. We work in partnership with governments and other public and private funders to expand technology access in public libraries, foster innovation in libraries, train library leaders, and advocate for policy changes that benefit public libraries.\n",
      "We fund projects and research on public access to information and the Internet, trends that affect how libraries serve their communities, and ways to foster innovation in libraries. These efforts help public library leaders and staff understand and quickly integrate innovative ideas, tools, and services in response to the changing needs of their communities.\n",
      "Projects in this area include a five-year global study on the impact of public access to the Internet and computers and a study by the Pew Research Center on U.S. public library use, with particular focus on e-books and digital content. They also include a grant to Worldreader, a literacy organization that is piloting the use of mobile devices and Kindles in public and community libraries in Kenya. The devices are preloaded with a wide variety of content in local languages, including reference books, textbooks, fiction, nonfiction, storybooks, and other information.\n",
      "We support efforts to identify strong library leaders and equip them to create high-impact libraries. Through leadership training, they can learn ways to foster a culture of innovation and risk taking, collaborate with others in the library field, create and test new service models, and engage community members and other stakeholders in the design and delivery of library services. \n",
      "For example, one effort we support is the International Network of Emerging Library Innovators (INELI), a network of library leaders around the world who have skills and experience in developing innovative services for users.\n",
      "We support efforts to create library programs and services that can be replicated on a broad scale and customized for different settings. Our primary focus is supporting technology access in public libraries on a national scale, particularly in developing countries and emerging economies. We also have a longstanding commitment to U.S. libraries. Each of these interventions focuses on long-term support from governments to ensure financial and service sustainability.\n",
      "We provide multi-year grants to government institutions or intermediary organizations in countries with a high need for public access to information and a readiness to implement technology access in public libraries. Our grants fund efforts to understand local information and technology needs, purchase equipment for libraries, train library staff, and help libraries build public support for long-term funding. Since 2002, we have supported nearly 13,000 libraries around the world that have provided training to more than 20,000 staff and over 1.5 million users.\n",
      "In addition to our work in the United States, we have supported large-scale efforts in Chile, Mexico, Botswana, Lithuania, Latvia, Romania, Ukraine, Poland, Bulgaria, Vietnam, Colombia, Indonesia, Moldova, Jamaica, South Africa, and Turkey. We have also worked on a smaller scale, through intermediaries, in Nepal, Bhutan, India, Guatemala, and Honduras.\n",
      "We work to ensure adequate resources and public policy support for libraries, and we help public libraries, library staff, and the library field measure the impact of public access in libraries and strengthen their advocacy skills.\n",
      "Our efforts in this area include the creation of a common measurement system for collecting data about how libraries contribute to key development issues such as health, education, and economic opportunity. We also funded a 17-country study in the European Union to measure users’ perceptions about the benefits of information technology in public libraries. In addition, with the assistance of the Global Libraries Advocacy Work Group, an international network of library advocacy specialists, we have developed a training curriculum to help build the advocacy skills and confidence of public library staff so they can ensure adequate funding and resources to meet the information needs of their communities. \n",

      "Families with children represent nearly half of the 20,000 homeless people in Washington State. About one child in four has a family that struggles to pay for basic needs such as food and housing.\n",
      "Many low-income children in the state enter kindergarten lacking basic language and behavioral skills; more than a third never graduate from high school.\n",
      "The foundation has invested more than $1 billion in Washington State to ensure a quality education for all children, reduce family homelessness, and support the most vulnerable families.\n",
      "One of our major education initiatives is the Road Map Project in South Seattle and South King County, where 60% of students are from minority and immigrant families and 54% are low income.\n",
      "Our work in Washington State is directed by David Bley and is part of the foundation’s United States Division.\n",
      "Washington State is a center of innovation and home to some of the most successful businesses in the world, yet problems of social inequity and poverty persist. More than 20,000 people are homeless on any given night in the state; families comprise almost half of this number. About one child in four has a family that struggles to pay for basic needs such as rent, food, and utilities.\n",
      "Due to the unaddressed effects of adversity in their lives, many low-income children in Washington enter school with lower cognitive, social-emotional, and language skills than other children, and 35% never graduate from high school. These young people and many of their parents are not prepared to compete for the good jobs available in this state, most of which require a college degree or postsecondary certificate.\n",
      "Even during better economic times, poverty and education in the state have been challenging issues. Too often, existing systems lack coordination and fail to focus sufficiently on root causes so they can try to prevent problems before they happen. The recent economic downturn and state budget crisis have underscored the need to work across systems and sectors and embrace new innovations.\n",
      "In addition to our efforts to improve the lives of Washington’s low-income families, we also support a number of global health and development organizations based in Washington that work around the globe—including PATH, Seattle BioMed, and Landesa—as well as research at public and private colleges and universities in the state. The $2 billion we have invested in these organizations and their programs includes funding for vaccine research and development, international family planning, support for small farmers, and many other health and development priorities. Funding is administered through our Global Health, Global Development, and Global Policy & Advocacy divisions.\n",
      "There is no single solution to poverty and its challenges, yet by supporting the region’s most vulnerable families in critical ways, we can increase their chances of having stable housing, finding employment, building a secure future, and raising healthy, confident children who can succeed in school, college, and life.\n",
      "Washington State has many dedicated service providers, government agencies, educational institutions, and community organizations that assist vulnerable families and low-income students. To make the most of their efforts, communities need coordinated, systematic, and mutually reinforcing approaches, the ability to innovate, reliable sources of funding, and public policies to support their work. Institutions, methods, and government policies must adapt to more effectively and efficiently serve at-risk populations, and program results must be rigorously measured and evaluated.\n",
      "Through research and the use of proven approaches from across the country, we have an opportunity to make a meaningful difference in the lives of tens of thousands of children and families across the state.\n",
      "In addition to grants disbursed by our Washington State program, the foundation occasionally makes civic grants to other organizations and projects in the region. Recent grants of this type include support for YMCA of Greater Seattle’s college access programs; Technology Access Foundation, which helps students of color learn STEM skills; and Bike Works Seattle, which promotes cycling among youth and teaches them bike repair and social entrepreneurship skills.\n",
      "Over the years, the foundation has also supported a number of arts, cultural, and civic institutions throughout the Northwest, including the Seattle Art Museum, Tacoma Art Museum, Children’s Museum of Skagit County, Seattle Symphony, and Seattle Jazzed.\n",
      "The work of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation spans the globe, but we have a deep commitment to improving the lives of families and children in Washington State, where the Gates family has lived for generations and the foundation makes its permanent home.\n",
      "We have invested more than $1 billion to ensure a quality education for all children, reduce family homelessness, and support the most vulnerable families in our state.\n",
      "Our strategy is built on partnerships with the public, private, and nonprofit sectors—including the regional and local philanthropic community—so that together we can create pathways to opportunity for all children and families in Washington.\n",
      "The best way to break the cycle of poverty is through education. In Washington State, we focus on promoting successful educational outcomes for all students through a holistic approach, starting at birth and culminating in a college degree or certificate. We call this effort Education Pathways because we aim to support every child on the path to success. We strive to create opportunities for students to learn more effectively through sound policies, by aligning systems that support young people, and by supporting better practice by teachers, principals, and parents. We specifically focus on enhancing opportunities for low-income students and students from diverse racial and cultural backgrounds.\n",
      "We must enlist the support of parents, educators, local communities, advocates, schools, and regional and state agencies to enhance the educational opportunities for our children. We do this by providing grants that support additional investments, such as federal funding from Race to the Top, or advancing work in five key areas that will help more students succeed:\n",
      "We work with public, private, and community partners to strengthen early learning opportunities that help children enter school ready to learn and succeed. While children need support from stable families, healthy communities, and great teaching at every step along their educational pathway, high-quality pre-K can help them get off to a strong start.\n",
      "Research shows that high-quality pre-K programs consistently focus on improving the interactions between teachers and children. They also share a set of features that foster high-quality instruction, support educators and young learners, and benefit from state and local policies that create a positive enabling environment. We believe that by supporting and scaling up these elements of quality, more children will enter school prepared and will achieve ongoing academic success. \n",
      "We support the Road Map Project in South Seattle and South King County, a community-driven effort to keep students on track, both in and out of school. Seven school districts, five higher education institutions, local governments, and hundreds of community organizations, education leaders, teachers, and parents are involved in creating a system where every student has the opportunities they need to succeed. Community-driven priorities include parent and community engagement, using data to set targets and rigorously measure results, monitoring early-warning signs to make sure students do not fall through the cracks, support for English language learners, kindergarten readiness, 3rd grade reading, expansion of college access and raising completion rates, and improving science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) skills. The Community Center for Education Results leads and coordinates this effort.\n",
      "This strong coalition helped the Road Map school districts secure a $40 million federal Race to the Top district grant in 2012, which will be used to expand early learning opportunities, enrich science and math learning, and offer support to high schools so more students can take college-prep courses and receive college advising.\n",
      "Participants in the Rainier Scholars program for promising students of color meet with a teacher at Seattle’s Aki Kurose Middle School.\n",
      "We support efforts to ensure there is a great teacher in every classroom, that every teacher gets the support they need to do their best teaching, and that there are strong instructional leaders in early learning settings and K-12 schools.  This includes support for a joint project of the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction, the Washington Education Association, and Educational Service District 113 to create an online tool for managing the state’s new teacher and principal evaluation process. We have also supported the work of the Association of Washington School Principals to develop a leadership framework aimed at improving student achievement. We recognize great teaching and schools that are helping to close the achievement gap by funding KCTS public television station’s Golden Apple and Pathways of Education Excellence awards.\n",
      "Homelessness has a profound impact on children’s health and education, as well as parents’ ability to find a job and stay employed. Homeless children have twice the rate of learning disabilities as children who are not homeless, and they have three times the rate of emotional and behavioral issues— including anxiety, depression, and withdrawal.\n",
      "In 2000, as a first step in addressing family homelessness in our state, the foundation launched the Sound Families Initiative, an eight-year, $40 million program aimed at tripling the amount of available transitional housing—and pairing it with support services in the state’s three most populous counties: King, Pierce, and Snohomish. By its close in 2008, the initiative had spurred the creation of more than 1,400 transitional homes for families emerging from homelessness.\n",
      "A family that found stable housing through the Washington Families Fund, a public-private partnership founded in 2004. \n",
      "Family homelessness has persisted, however, and our job is far from done. We have chosen to invest in a new way going forward, based on the lessons learned from our experiences and on promising practices used around the nation. We are working with Building Changes, a Seattle-based nonprofit, and the governments of King, Pierce, and Snohomish counties to more efficiently deploy existing funding and services from a broad range of sources. Building Changes works to align public and private efforts to prevent and combat homelessness. It also encourages governments at all levels, service providers, and philanthropic donors to collaborate in developing and disseminating innovative approaches and to help the various systems work in mutually reinforcing ways on behalf of families.\n",
      "Meaningful reductions in family homelessness can be achieved only through a systematic, coordinated approach that provides at-risk families with the help they need, when they need it. Until recently, families who became homeless in Washington State had to contact multiple agencies for different kinds of assistance. Many languished on waiting lists for months. Those who obtained temporary housing often had to wait more than a year to get into a permanent home.\n",
      "All of this is slowly beginning to change. To bring about systemic improvements, we identified five principles that have helped successfully reduce family homelessness in other U.S. communities. These principles guide our investments and the work of our community partners:\n",
      "We believe that strong communities need the capacity to solve their own problems. We work to strengthen local philanthropic institutions, such as community foundations and United Way organizations, because these partners know their local communities better than we do. These partners use their local knowledge and strong networks to address the unique needs of their communities—and in many cases they re-grant foundation funds to smaller nonprofits, local projects, and community­-building initiatives.\n",
      "We also make investments aimed at strengthening the channels through which nonprofits and community leaders access knowledge and technical assistance about organizational effectiveness and strong community partnerships. By increasing the quality and availability of nonprofit technical assistance, we are better able to understand and address the needs of vulnerable families.\n",
      "We know that the best ideas often come from our partners, who work directly with students and families, and we regularly seek their input. We seek ideas for community and school collaborations that can enhance educational success for low-income students both during and outside of school hours. Information about funding for such ideas can be found here.\n",

      "\t\t\tOur Grand Challenges programs have awarded grants for early-stage research to more than 1,000 innovators in over 50 countries.\r\n",
      "\t\t\n",
      "Working closely with the foundation’s other global programs, we seek to channel resources into scientific discovery to create more practical versions of existing solutions and develop new solutions where needed.\n",
      "Our areas of focus include vaccines, drugs, diagnostics, maternal and child health, and control of disease-transmitting mosquitoes.\n",
      "To speed the translation of scientific discovery into implementable solutions, we seek better ways to evaluate and refine potential interventions before they enter costly and time-consuming late-stage clinical trials.\n",
      "Through our grant programs, including the Grand Challenges programs, we aim to engage the world’s most innovative researchers and to build a global network of research initiatives and funding partners.\n",
      "Our Discovery & Translational Sciences strategy is led by Chris Wilson, director, and is part of the foundation’s Global Health Division.\n",
      "Research and innovation are essential for improving people’s health and saving lives. Vaccines prevent devastating infections and illnesses, drugs help manage and treat disease, and diagnostic tools, medical devices, and other health-related interventions enable providers to anticipate, prevent, diagnose, and manage illness and thereby improve people’s overall health. Increasingly, these tools are yielding significant benefits for the world’s poorest and most vulnerable populations.\n",
      "But too many health conditions in the developing world still lack effective, appropriate, and affordable solutions. And too little funding is directed toward problems that disproportionately affect the world’s poor. According to some estimates, only 10 percent of all medical research is devoted to conditions that account for 90 percent of the global disease burden. Moreover, due to limited support for research that addresses some of the most neglected diseases and populations, the world’s best scientists are not sufficiently engaged.\n",
      "We urgently need to develop and implement new strategies to achieve the eradication of polio. We need new vaccines for HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis (TB). Treatments for diseases such as TB and malaria are becoming less effective due to drug resistance. Many diagnostic tools are either inadequate or not available in poor communities. Better contraceptives are needed to address the demand for family planning options, as are new, more holistic approaches to ensuring healthy birth, growth, and development.\n",
      "While discovery research can increase the likelihood of dramatic progress in tackling persistent global health and development problems, we must ensure that it is focused for maximum impact. We must foster bold innovation and identify and pursue potentially transformative ideas, despite a high risk of failure.\n",
      "Wireless patches that monitor the vital signs of pregnant women and fetuses could provide an inexpensive way to advance research on preterm birth.\n",
      "Dramatic progress in global health and development can be made if research institutions, governments, foundations, nongovernmental organizations, and private industry join together to generate new discoveries and new technologies that could greatly improve outcomes for families and children. \n",
      "To reveal new ways to solve key health problems, we must work together to fill gaps in knowledge about the causes of those problems. From the start of projects, we must consider the path through development and delivery of a solution, anticipating how to test a tool or technology, how to introduce it, and who will use and pay for it. And we must promote cross-discipline collaboration and coordination among researchers and funders to help ensure that solutions are developed that will be sustainable and will have impact at the greatest possible scale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Working closely with other global programs at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Discovery & Translational Sciences program aims to create and improve preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic interventions for infectious diseases as well as other conditions that affect mothers, infants, and children. We do this by identifying and filling gaps in scientific knowledge, creating or implementing new technology platforms that can accelerate research in support of our goals, and investing in potentially transformative ideas.\n",
      "All of our investments advance the goal of creating solutions that can be deployed, accepted, and sustained in the developing world. To speed the translation of scientific discovery into implementable solutions, we seek better ways to evaluate and refine potential interventions—such as vaccine candidates—before they enter costly and time-consuming late-stage clinical trials.\n",
      "We seek ideas and solutions from creative minds across the globe and from diverse fields, and we invest in discovery research through a variety of mechanisms, including our Grand Challenges grant programs. Together with our Grand Challenges partners, including government agencies and other donor institutions, we work to define areas of urgent need, foster collaboration among researchers, and build a global network of research initiatives and funders.\n",
      "Our efforts fall into four main areas: vaccine discovery, drug discovery, maternal and child health, and control of disease-transmitting mosquitoes.\n",
      "A number of problems plague the development of vaccines against infectious diseases, including insufficient quality and diversity of preclinical candidates, slow entry into and limited throughput in early-stage test-of-concept trials in humans, and the high cost of clinical trials. It typically takes 15 to 20 years to go from target discovery to deployment of a new vaccine even when the paradigm is well established, which is not the case for diseases such as HIV, TB, and malaria, for which new approaches are required.\n",
      "We invest in technologies that can identify promising vaccine candidates and refine them before they enter costly and time-consuming late-stage clinical trials. We also invest in research to better understand the health factors that affect susceptibility to infectious diseases and vaccine efficacy, such as malnutrition and co-infections. Furthermore, we seek more effective models of collaboration with major vaccine manufacturers to better identify and pursue mutually beneficial opportunities. \n",
      "Our vaccine discovery efforts focus on developing vaccine technologies and closing knowledge gaps to facilitate the eradication of polio, testing a new strategy for developing next-generation malaria vaccines and transmission-blocking immunotherapeutics, developing a broadly effective HIV/AIDS vaccine, and enabling more rational and accelerated development of TB vaccine candidates.\n",
      "Antimicrobial drugs have been the cornerstone of infectious disease treatment, but relatively few treatment options are available for the diseases that have the greatest impact in the developing world. Drug-resistant TB and malaria are also growing problems.\n",
      "We work to speed the identification of the best drug candidates, and, as we do with vaccine discovery, we look for opportunities to collaborate with pharmaceutical companies because of their unique resources and expertise and to foster productive academic-industry interactions. We also seek to develop new technologies and approaches to slow the evolution and spread of drug resistance, including alternative formulations and drug-delivery technologies.\n",
      "We support efforts to create a new generation of more effective and less toxic drugs to treat malaria, TB, visceral leishmaniasis (black fever), human African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness), onchocerciasis (river blindness), and lymphatic filariasis (elephantiasis), and to control severe diarrhea.\n",
      "A broad range of scientific studies are needed to identify how maternal, fetal, newborn, and infant health outcomes are affected by factors including nutrition, infection, and exposure to environmental toxins.\n",
      "We invest in research to discover the causes of preterm birth (PTB), which is a leading cause of infant mortality, and to develop innovative strategies for prevention. Efforts include developing biomarkers for PTB, which can be applied in early pregnancy to predict impending PTB and thereby target use of established preventive measures and treatments. We fund projects to establish metrics for, and discover the causes of, growth faltering in utero and during the first two years of life—a window of time in which serious health problems can impair growth and affect long-term health—and to develop new ways to prevent or reverse unhealthy growth marked by stunting and wasting. Through our Grand Challenges Explorations program and other efforts, we are seeking new approaches to measuring physical growth, brain function, and development in order to better guide and monitor healthy growth interventions.\n",
      "Mosquitoes spread many serious diseases, including malaria and dengue fever, to millions of people annually. A primary strategy for fighting these diseases is the use of insecticides to kill disease-transmitting mosquitoes. Mosquitoes have grown increasingly resistant to available insecticides, however, and some insecticides are too toxic for widespread use. They also can require people to change their behavior—to use bed nets, for instance—and they need funding to maintain distribution systems.\n",
      "Our investments in mosquito control include nontraditional biological and genetic approaches as well as new chemical interventions aimed at depleting or incapacitating disease-transmitting mosquito populations. One biological control project for dengue fever that began through our Grand Challenges in Global Health grant program has progressed to field trials in Australia, Indonesia, and Vietnam. \n",
      "One way that we spur breakthrough advances in global health and development is through our Grand Challenges family of initiatives, which uses open requests for proposals to engage investigators across disciplines and across the world—including those who have not traditionally taken part in this type of research—to seek innovative solutions to persistent challenges.\n",
      "A device under development by a U.S. company uses microneedles and vacuum suction to safely and painlessly collect blood samples for medical diagnosis.\n",
      "The Grand Challenges in Global Health initiative was launched in 2003 with a focus on challenges in improving health in the developing world. We awarded 45 grants totaling more than US$450 million to scientists in 33 countries. In 2011, we began launching new programs under the initiative, and given that its scope has expanded to encompass global development, we now refer to the initiative simply as Grand Challenges. \n",
      "In 2008, we launched Grand Challenges Explorations to encourage even bolder approaches in specific areas. Anyone with a great idea can apply using a simple two-page online application; no preliminary data is required. Initial grants are for US$100,000, and successful projects have the opportunity to receive a follow-on grant of up to US$1 million. \n",
      "To date, more than 1,000 Grand Challenges Explorations grants have been awarded to investigators in over 50 countries, and the initiative is being used by teams across the foundation. Recent challenge topics have included new ways to measure infant brain development and gestational age and new approaches to promoting health-seeking behavior.\n",
      "Governments and nongovernmental organizations around the world are developing their own Grand Challenges initiatives and committing significant funds, both independently and in partnership with the foundation. The Canadian government has funded the not-for-profit organization Grand Challenges Canada to support global health projects that integrate scientific, social, and business innovation. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has launched a series of Grand Challenges for Development programs, including Saving Lives at Birth (which includes Grand Challenges Canada and the foundation as partners) and, more recently, Fighting Ebola. We are also participating in the country-specific partnerships Grand Challenges Brazil, Grand Challenges India, and Grand Challenges South Africa.\n",
      "In 2014, Bill and Melinda Gates and a diverse group of research and funding partners launched the next phase of Grand Challenges, which includes three new programs: Putting Women and Girls at the Center of Development; Creating and Measuring Integrated Solutions for Healthy Birth, Growth, and Development (part of the All Children Thriving platform); and New Interventions for Global Health.\n",
      "Ethical, social, and cultural considerations are important in all of the foundation’s work. Not only do we strive to be respectful and sensitive to the communities we work with, but we also aim to design our efforts to ensure the greatest chance of acceptance, which is a prerequisite for success. \n",
      "An international team of biologists is investigating ways to shorten the lifespan of mosquitoes that transmit the dengue virus.\n",
      "Originally focused on supporting the Grand Challenges in Global Health initiative, our Ethical, Social, and Cultural (ESC) program now works with teams across the foundation to anticipate and address cultural barriers to global health and development initiatives. Examples of the program’s recent work include developing community engagement guidelines for tuberculosis drug trials, providing guidance for polio-related data sharing, and developing a collaboration model to promote cooperation and trust between public and private groups that work to improve infant and young child nutrition.\n",

      "More than 300 natural disasters have occurred each year over the past decade. In 2013 alone, natural disasters killed more than 21,000 people, affected more than 96 million others, and resulted in estimated economic damage of US$118.6 billion.\n",
      "Our investments support relief efforts in response to rapid-onset natural disasters such as cyclones, earthquakes, and disease outbreaks (including the Ebola epidemic); slow-onset crises such as famine and drought; and acute complex emergencies related to political unrest and violence.\n",
      "The relief agencies we support deliver food and clean water, improve sanitation, provide medical attention and shelter, prevent or minimize outbreaks of disease, administer cash-for-work programs, and provide other services in response to urgent needs.\n",
      "Our strategy also includes investments to strengthen our partners’ response capacity and equip them with innovative approaches and tools.\n",
      "Emergencies occur nearly every day and affect thousands of communities around the world, leaving people in urgent need of help to survive and recover. While some emergencies, such as Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines and Cyclone Phailin in India in 2013, gain widespread media coverage, many others are poorly publicized and receive little public attention. The circumstances can range from catastrophic rapid-onset natural disasters and disease outbreaks to slow-onset crises such as food shortages, drought, and gender-based violence and displacement of populations due to war and civil unrest.\n",
      "Both rapid and slow-onset emergencies can erase hard-won development gains and hinder progress, significantly reducing community resilience. After decades of natural and man-made disasters, often exacerbated by climate change and chronic conflict, many countries are facing emergencies as the “new normal.”\n",
      "Rapid assistance can save lives during an emergency. With immediate and flexible financial support, relief agencies and local organizations that are first responders can deliver help within days—when the needs are most significant and immediate response is critical. Slow-onset emergencies, such as food crises due to drought, require targeted support to help people recover and build community resilience to cope with future shocks.\n",
      "Our support ensures that our partners are better prepared to respond to, and recover from, emergency situations and help communities “build back better” with innovative tools and approaches.\n",
      "The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation’s Emergency Response program aims to reduce suffering, disease, and death in countries affected by natural disasters and complex emergencies. In addition to responding directly to emergencies, we work to help improve the speed and performance of first responders in the first critical hours of an emergency. We also invest in strengthening the ability of first responders, their organizations, and local institutions to help communities prepare for and cope with future shocks. \n",
      "In addition, we collaborate with other foundation programs to develop and introduce innovative products and approaches that can save lives and build community resilience before an emergency occurs.\n",
      "The emergencies we respond to, which often number in the dozens per year, have included the Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa, cholera outbreaks in Cameroon, floods and landslides in Kashmir and Nepal, Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, and conflict and displacement in the Central African Republic and South Sudan.\n",
      "We work to strengthen the effectiveness of local and national responders, organizations, and institutions that are inevitably the first responders because they are on the ground before international help arrives and are best placed to understand the needs of their communities. We support these organizations in sharing effective approaches with one another, developing disaster-planning programs, and cultivating leaders who will be able to act quickly and effectively during an emergency. We are currently carrying out pilot projects in Bangladesh, India, Central America, and the Horn of Africa.\n",
      "By helping communities build strong systems, we can strengthen their ability to “build back better” in the wake of a crisis. We can also promote a shift in the humanitarian sector from purely reactive responses to proactive preparation.\n",
      "We evaluate our investments by gathering data on successful models and approaches, and we use this information to inform our future investments.\n",
      "Our Emergency Response program collaborates with other foundation programs to develop and study new approaches to disaster assistance, including innovative tools and technologies. For example, we have supported research and pilot-testing of approaches to improving water and sanitation in emergencies. We have also jointly developed innovations with the foundation’s Water, Sanitation & Hygiene, Enteric and Diarrheal Diseases, and Vaccine Delivery teams—including chlorine dispensers, the global oral cholera vaccine (OCV) stockpile, new toilet prototypes, and improved slum sanitation methods. \n",

      "To bring about the kinds of changes that will help people live healthier and more productive lives, we seek to understand the world’s inequities. Whether the challenge is low-yield crops in Africa or low graduation rates in Los Angeles, we listen and learn so we can identify pressing problems that get too little attention. Then we consider whether we can make a meaningful difference with our influence and our investments, whether it is a grant or a contract.\n",
      "All of our strategies—more than two dozen across the foundation—have emerged through this process of identifying what we want to accomplish for people and where we can have the greatest impact. Once we commit to an area of need, we define our major goals and identify a clear path to achieving them.\n",
      "The issues we engage in are wildly disparate, but they share the characteristics of being deeply rooted, dynamic, and complex. None will be solved easily and quickly, and none will be solved through our efforts alone. \n",
      "We do all of our work in collaboration with grantees and other partners, who join with us in taking risks, pushing for new solutions, and harnessing the transformative power of science and technology. We strive to engage with our grantees and partners in a spirit of trust, candid communication, and transparency. Our collective efforts also depend on the support and resources of governments, the private sector, communities, and individuals.\n",
      "In each of our divisions, we develop goals and strategies before allocating resources and making investments. We continually collect and share data on our progress, reflect on lessons learned, and make course corrections as needed. Essential to this process is ongoing dialogue with our grantees and partners—which is embedded throughout our strategy lifecycle.\n",
      "At this stage of the foundation’s growth, our divisions and strategies are already in place. We reflect on and review each strategy annually, and make adjustments to our implementation plan toward achieving our goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Within each strategy, which has an allocation of resources, we collaborate with grantee and partner organizations to develop proposals that align with our strategic priorities and the organization’s focus and capabilities. An important part of this process is reaching agreement on what success will look like for the investment.\n",
      "We use a standard four-phase process to develop all of our grants and contracts. The duration of each phase depends on the complexity of the project as well as the capacity and geographic location of the prospective partner. \n",
      "Phase 1: Concept Development. Our program officers work to identify ideas that support our strategic priorities, in consultation with foundation colleagues, researchers, policymakers, and other partners in the field.  This phase concludes with an internal decision that a concept is aligned to a strategy, and we should proceed with development work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Phase 2: Pre-Proposal. We use a variety of ways to explore and refine concepts, with the help of organizations in the field. Regardless of the approach, we remain committed to understanding the perspective of others, in order to further shape the proposed body of work. This phase ends with the decision to solicit a grant or contract proposal.\n",
      "-Direct solicitation. When we know that an organization is well-suited to perform the work, we directly solicit an early phase concept memo or proposal. \n",
      "-Discussion. In some cases, we invite one or more organizations to discuss the concept with us and explore their interest and their capacity to undertake the work. If the organization has the expertise, capacity, and interest, we will invite them to submit a concept memo or proposal. \n",
      "-Request for proposal (RFP): When we want to broaden our network or fund multiple organizations for a project, we may issue an RFP. Public RFPs are posted on our website; private RFPs are directed to specific organizations.  \n",
      "Phase 3: Investment Development.We give applicants guidelines and templates for developing a proposal, a budget, and a results framework and tracker. A program officer reviews submitted materials with internal and, at times, external experts and works with the applicant to integrate recommended changes. We also complete our due diligence, confirm the applicant organization’s tax status, determine how to structure the transaction, and assess risk. Our legal and financial analysis teams may also participate during this phase.\n",
      "Investment proposals are reviewed at various levels, with more levels of review for grants and contracts that are more complex. A foundation executive makes the final decision about whether to fund the proposed grant or contract. Before funded activities can commence, the foundation and the partner organization sign an agreement that includes intended results, targets, milestones or reporting deliverables, and a payment schedule.\n",
      "Phase 4: Management and Close. During the life of an investment, the program officer and partner discuss how they will work together and keep in close communication to understand progress and challenges of ongoing work. By maintaining quality interactions and clear and consistent communication, they are able to share feedback early and often. Occasionally a program officer or foundation staff member will participate on advisory committees, and occasionally take a seat on the board of the organization. \n",
      "At the end of the project, the partner will work with the program officer to submit a final report that summarizes the results achieved and lessons learned.\n",
      "We structure grants in a way that makes sense from a financial perspective while also funding partners for the cost of delivering results, supported by open and honest dialogue about the resources required. As grant proposals are developed, we try to gain a complete and accurate understanding of the total cost to execute the project efficiently and effectively.\n",
      "In order to expedite global health research and to develop sustainable research capacity, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation periodically reviews its funding model to universities and other research partners. It is important to us that our grantees understand our current funding model as it relates to the different approaches taken by other funders. Foundations have flexibility in accounting for facilities and administrative (F&A) or “indirect costs” as “direct costs,” unlike the federal government. For example, project management, lab charges, and data/IT charges that are related to a specific project are allowable as direct costs in a Gates Foundation grant. Thus, item by item analysis is required to accurately compare a Gates Foundation grant versus a grant funded by another entity. Details regarding our Grantee Indirect Cost Policy can be found here. \n",
      "From the outset of the grantmaking process, we work with partners to define the overall results we hope to achieve and the data needed to measure those results. We call this approach outcome investing.\n",
      "To give our partners flexibility in how they achieve results, we do not require them to report on all of their activities. Instead, we focus on purposefully measuring the most critical metrics of progress that support continued learning, adjustment, and alignment. However, the nature and frequency of measurement depends on the type of work. For example, scientific research projects may be measured differently than efforts to expand vaccine coverage. Watch this video for more information on our Outcome Investing approach.\n",
      "Evaluation is another collaborative learning tool that provides us and our partners with feedback so we can improve, adjust, and decide how best to achieve outcomes. We work to ensure that our partners have the capacity and support to generate quality evidence. \n",
      "Our foundation evaluation policy sets out parameters for evaluation and explains how and why we use evaluation and where variation is warranted. We acknowledge the ongoing debate about evaluation methods in many fields in which we work. We avoid one-size-fits-all prescriptions and strive to make selective, high-quality evaluation an integral part of how we carry out our work. \n",

      "In low-income communities, many women and newborns die during pregnancy and childbirth from conditions that can be easily prevented using cost-effective interventions.\n",
      "We invest in the development and delivery of interventions that can be used by families and health workers in low-resource settings to improve the survival and health of women, newborns, and young children. \n",
      "We advocate for policies and programs that support expanded coverage of high-impact interventions in countries with high burdens of maternal, newborn, and child deaths.\n",
      "Our Maternal, Newborn & Child Health Program is led by Hugh Chang, interim director, and is part of the foundation’s Global Development Division.\n",
      "Since 1990, maternal deaths worldwide have dropped by 45 percent, but every day about 800 women die from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth. Almost all of these deaths occur in low-income settings as a result of conditions that include severe bleeding, infection, high blood pressure, and complications during delivery. \n",
      "Maternal health is closely linked to newborn survival. While great strides have been made in reducing global child mortality, newborns now account for 44 percent of all childhood deaths. Each year, 2.9 million newborns needlessly die within their first month and an additional 2.6 million are stillborn. The main causes, which are preventable and treatable, are complications due to prematurity, complications during delivery, and infection.\n",
      "Proven, high-impact interventions are available, but they are not reaching all of the women and newborns who need them. Although facility births are increasing in all regions and income groups, quality of care at birth remains a major challenge. Many women give birth at home and may not see a skilled health worker before or after delivery. Skilled health workers often lack access to critical supplies and medicines.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most maternal and newborn deaths can be prevented using existing, proven, cost-effective interventions: antibiotics, cord care (including sterile blades for cutting umbilical cords), drugs that prevent and treat postpartum hemorrhage, resuscitation, immediate and exclusive breastfeeding, and kangaroo mother care to keep the newborn warm with skin-to-skin contact and breastfed. An increasing number of women are seeking to deliver their babies at first-level facilities, which provides an opportunity to expand quality services around the time of birth. \n",
      "Such cost-effective interventions can significantly reduce maternal and newborn mortality. Further improvements are also possible through the development of new tools and technologies that enable earlier, faster, and more accurate assessment of gestational age and diagnosis and treatment of dangerous conditions, including measures to prevent preterm death. \n",
      "Increasing the coverage of family planning services, especially among high-risk adolescent girls, can help significantly reduce maternal and newborn mortality. Improvement in the quality of antenatal and postpartum services can help strengthen the link between family planning and maternal and newborn health. \n",
      "The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation’s Maternal, Newborn & Child Health program works to expand coverage of high-impact interventions to ensure that women and newborns survive and stay healthy during childbirth and beyond. We invest in efforts to adapt and develop innovative tools, technologies, and treatments; improve the quality of healthcare services and practices and the interactions between health workers and families; and advocate for national and global policies that benefit maternal, newborn, and child survival and health.\n",
      "We work closely with governments, United Nations and bilateral agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and the private sector, and we collaborate with other programs at the foundation in areas such as discovery, integrated delivery, nutrition, family planning, childhood infectious diseases, policy and advocacy, and communications.\n",
      "We support research across discovery, development, and implementation sciences in many parts of the world that can lead to better ways to save the lives of women and newborns and improve their health. \n",
      "Our efforts to achieve impact on a broad scale are currently focused in Ethiopia, northern Nigeria, and the Indian states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. These areas account for a significant portion of the world’s maternal and newborn deaths.\n",
      "A new mother in Katsina, Nigeria, practices kangaroo mother care with her newborn who was born prematurely.  © Save the Children\n",
      "To address the primary risk factors for maternal and newborn deaths, we work to adapt existing preventive and curative tools, technologies, and treatments as well as develop new ones that are more effective and affordable and will be more readily accepted by families and health workers in rural and community clinics, health centers, and hospitals. These include ways to manage postpartum hemorrhage, treat newborn infections using simplified antibiotic treatment regimens, and clean the umbilical cord.\n",
      "We work to help community-level healthcare providers advance their knowledge and skills and expand their use of innovative tools. One key priority is improving the quality of care in primary healthcare facilities where women give birth. Health workers can also improve outcomes for women and children by disseminating good health practices such as hand washing, immunization, postpartum family planning, and exclusive breastfeeding.\n",
      "We seek to identify and reduce barriers to the adoption of effective interventions, disseminate information about maternal and newborn health, conduct large-scale educational campaigns, mobilize local networks to improve household and community practices and social norms, and reduce financial barriers to obtaining care.\n",
      "To reach adolescent girls, who are particularly at risk during pregnancy and childbirth, we work with the foundation’s Family Planning and Nutrition programs on ways to deliver integrated services. \n",
      "By strengthening the skills and capacities of local advocates, we promote policies and strategies that enable countries to increase the use of lifesaving health interventions, raise awareness of overlooked risk factors for newborn and maternal mortality, and expand the use of essential medicines. We also work to achieve global agreement on a set of uniform standards for health targets and measurements, which will help with planning, monitoring, and more informed decision making.\n",

      "We are improving our process for making and managing grants and other investments. Our goal is to increase impact and provide more time to innovate and build strong relationships with you, our partners, to ultimately achieve results for the people we serve, together.\n",
      "The foundation recently launched a standard, streamlined process and scalable tools that will be used for most 2014 grants and direct charitable contracts. Grantees with existing investments (made prior to or in very early 2014) will not change to the new process and tools, in most cases. Foundation staff will provide guidance on the appropriate process and tools to use.\n",
      "Q. How do I apply for a grant from the foundation?\n",
      "A. We do not make grants outside our funding priorities. In general, we directly invite proposals by directly contacting organizations. We do occasionally award grants through published Requests for Proposals (RFPs) or letters of inquiry. View a list of current RFP and open Concept Memos.\n",
      "Q. I have materials I want to submit along with my request for funding. How do I send them?\n",
      "A. Please submit only the requested forms. We are not able to accept samples, prototypes, or other supplementary materials that accompany requests for funding, and these items will not be returned.\n",
      "Q. My funding request does not fall under any of your programs. How do I submit it?\n",
      "A. We do not make grants outside our funding priorities. \n",
      "Q. I am an individual seeking financial assistance. Am I eligible for a grant?\n",
      "A. In keeping with our charter, we do not provide funding to individuals. \n",
      "Q. I am raising money for a cause. Am I eligible for a grant?\n",
      "A. The foundation makes grants to organizations directly rather than through individual fundraising activities; therefore, we are unable to fund your effort. \n",
      "Q. What does the recently launched investment process mean for grantseekers?\n",
      "A. Our new process and tools are designed to focus documentation and analysis on the key topics and to reduce unnecessary work. The process helps us work more effectively internally, reducing questions of grantseekers and rework late in the development of an investment. Most of our work in 2014 will be developed using the new process and tools.  In general, existing grantees will not rely on the new tools and process. \n",
      "Q. When did the foundation start using the new process and templates?\n",
      "A. The foundation started using the new process and tools with 2014 investments. A subset of the foundation tested the process and tools in late spring with some 2013 investments, followed by a phased transition for the rest of the foundation in summer/winter of 2013.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some template design work is continuing in 2014.  New standard terms and conditions for our agreements were launched in early 2014 for new investments, and new budget and fiscal report templates will be available later in 2014.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, later in 2014 we will launch a streamlined process and toolset for administrative contracts (i.e., contracts we enter into to support the operation and management of the foundation).\n",
      "Q. How much time will grantseekers have to spend on submitting a new investment?\n",
      "A. Just as today, that varies depending on the complexity of the investment. We anticipate that while more time may be spent upfront to align on investment results and the approach to measurement and reporting, we anticipate that less time will be required on late stage requests, analysis, and rework.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q.Who makes decisions on investments and when?\n",
      "A. As part of its operating model, the foundation delegates decision making on grants and contracts to leaders across the organization. With our new process, decision makers are identified at the early stage of an investment. Check-in points are built in to help ensure that decision makers are informed about and can raise questions during development, rather than holding all questions until the end.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q. What documents will grantseekers need to complete?\n",
      "A. The typical set of documents includes a proposal narrative, a budget and narrative, and a results framework and tracker. The grantseeker may also complete a concept memo at a very early stage to outline an investment.\n",
      "Once a grant is approved, the grantee will typically rely on the results tracker, progress narrative, and fiscal reports to report formally on progress, challenges, and financial status.\n",
      "Many of these templates are similar to what grantees have used before, however, they are standardized across the foundation and have been designed to scale with the complexity of the investment, and include fewer rote questions.\n",
      "Q. How will investment results be measured and reported on?\n",
      "A. The Results Tracker is a tool that will help the prospective grantee plan for how they will measure results (i.e. outcomes and outputs) and report on progress against them over the course of the investment. This tool will be used during the investment development and management phases of the grant. The Progress/Final Report Narrative will also be used by the grantee at each reporting period to provide a descriptive summary of progress toward results. \n",

      "Tobacco use is the world’s leading cause of preventable death, with nearly 6 million people dying of tobacco-related diseases each year.\n",
      "Tobacco use has accelerated in low- and middle-income countries, where the tobacco industry is increasing its aggressive marketing, often directed at women and children.\n",
      "We support the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, an international treaty that compels its 179 signatory countries to meet minimum tobacco control provisions.\n",
      "We support partners who are working to address the tobacco epidemic in more than 30 countries in Africa and Asia. \n",
      "Our Tobacco Control strategy is led by Cynthia Lewis, deputy director of Global Policy & Advocacy, and is part of the foundation’s Global Policy & Advocacy Division.\n",
      "Worldwide, more than 1 billion people use tobacco products—the only consumer products that, when used as directed, will kill half of all users. Tobacco use is the world’s leading cause of preventable death, with nearly 6 million people dying of tobacco-related diseases each year, including more than 600,000 nonsmokers who are exposed to secondhand smoke. If current trends persist, tobacco will kill more than 8 million people each year by 2030—80 percent of them in the developing world.\n",
      "In recent years, tobacco use has stagnated in higher-income countries while accelerating in low- and middle-income countries. Tobacco industry revenue continues to climb, and aggressive marketing of tobacco products in the developing world is increasing, often directed at women and children. Many of these countries lack strong tobacco control policies and have little awareness of the health effects of tobacco. In countries that grow tobacco and produce tobacco products, the tobacco industry has enormous influence on public policy and wages relentless and well-funded advertising, promotion, and sponsorship campaigns.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2003, the World Health Organization adopted the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), the world’s first and only global public health treaty. The FCTC compels its 179 signatory countries—many of which are low- and middle-income—to meet minimum standards in tobacco control provisions, offering a powerful lever for tobacco control efforts worldwide. The measures contained in the FCTC provisions have proven cost-effective and successful in reducing tobacco use in higher-income countries and have the potential to significantly advance tobacco control efforts in low- and middle-income countries. We see great opportunities in the following regions and countries:\n",
      "Many of the FCTC’s 179 signatories are low- and middle-income countries, where tobacco control has often been a lower priority than other health challenges. Governments frequently lack data on tobacco-related health issues, tobacco industry interference remains high, and the capacity of tobacco control advocates and policymakers to implement control measures is uneven. \n",
      "Bill Gates and Michael Bloomberg have called on government and business leaders to make the fight against tobacco use a higher priority.\n",
      "The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation’s Tobacco Control program works to address these challenges by supporting a well-coordinated network of strategic partners who are based primarily in the regions where we work—Africa, China, and Southeast Asia—and who are able to effect change through effective sub-grants and efforts to build the capacity of civil society organizations and governments. Since 2008, we have committed nearly US$210 million to partners who are working to address the tobacco epidemic in more than 30 countries in Africa and Asia. Bloomberg Philanthropies is a key partner in this work; we closely coordinate our tobacco control efforts in Asia and support highly complementary efforts in other geographies. \n",
      "While clinical smoking cessation is not a focus of our investments, we acknowledge its critical role in limiting overall tobacco-related death and disease and we applaud the efforts of other organizations in this area. We also recognize the importance of other needs in tobacco control, such as considering alternative livelihoods for tobacco farmers and addressing cross-border smuggling. We monitor these issues closely and take them into account when we make strategic decisions about how to allocate our funds to reduce tobacco use.\n",
      "Tobacco control policy interventions save lives. Among them, tobacco taxation offers a particularly crucial advantage in addition to reducing tobacco use—it can provide much-needed domestic revenue to help fund a range of public health and development efforts. Working through strategic partners in Africa, China, and Southeast Asia, we support education and advocacy at the country level for implementation of FCTC provisions, particularly tobacco taxes that raise the price of cigarettes for the consumer, comprehensive bans on tobacco advertising, graphic health warning labels and plain cigarette packaging, and indoor smoking bans. We support local, regional, and global partners who can coordinate with and build the capacity of advocates and policymakers to implement these measures. \n",
      "When policy change approaches are combined with targeted and creative social marketing to educate the public and policymakers and shift perceptions related to tobacco use, the two efforts can be mutually reinforcing and lead to significant and lasting change. We support partners in Africa and Asia who are leading both traditional mass media campaigns as well as more targeted and innovative campaigns to shift knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions about tobacco use, tobacco products, and the tobacco industry among current tobacco users and those at risk.\n",
      "Without accurate information on the size and nature of the challenges and successes in tobacco control, governments in low- and middle-income countries have limited ability to draft or implement effective policies. Tobacco control advocates need local data to support the case they make to governments—and to counter the powerful influence of the tobacco industry’s misinformation. We support local and global research efforts to build this critical evidence base, including new and updated economic analyses on tax policy and the economic impact of taxation, data on tobacco consumption among youth and adults, global tobacco industry tracking, and research on cigarette smuggling. \n",

      "As we have in past years, we surveyed our grantees in 2014 to learn more about their experience in working with us.  We invited 2,647 grantees to participate in the survey and heard back from 2,000 (a 76 percent response rate).  \n",
      "In addition, we received completed surveys from 19 non-grantee partners and 76 contractors with whom we are working on direct charitable expense (DCE) contracts. We also worked with an independent firm to interview 98 individuals from some of our largest partners across the foundation and around the world.\n",
      "Clearly, many of you invested considerable time in helping us learn more about how we are doing our job. We greatly appreciate the willingness of so many of you to take valuable time to respond to the survey and the interviews.\n",
      "I’m pleased with the thoughtfulness of the feedback that you have shared with us. Because we think it is so important for us to be transparent with you, I’m sharing our foundation-wide survey results with you in their entirety for the first time. \n",
      "We should not be happy with the results of this survey. They indicate that at least some of your interactions with us are negative – or at least less constructive than they could be. I am committed to improving our performance. After all, our relationship with grantees and partners is the lifeblood of our foundation. We should not be content with anything less than excellent performance in this area.\n",
      "Several years ago, we established Our Commitment to Grantees, which includes three tenets: quality interactions, clear and consistent communications, and opportunities for feedback. From the results of this survey, it’s clear that we have work to do on all three fronts. \n",
      "I’m working with leadership and employees throughout the Gates Foundation to identify the areas where we are coming up short. I’m committed to taking effective and sustained action to get us to where we need to be, and building the productive collaborations that we know are necessary to advance our shared missions. \n",

      "9. Children\n",
      "We do not want to collect information from children. Do not provide any personal information unless you are at least 13 years of age, and please caution your children not to provide any.

It applies if you use the “Jobs” section of the Site or if you allow or cause someone else to use it for you. If an applicant has a disability and needs assistance using our online systems, completing a profile, an application for employment, or any other aspect of the application process, please notify our Disability Coordinator (at disability.accomodations@gatesfoundation.org) and we will make appropriate arrangements. We are an equal opportunity employer.\n",
      "This Jobs Policy is part of our Privacy and Information Security Policy (\"Privacy Policy\") which is part of our Terms of Use; terms used but not defined in this Jobs Policy are defined in those documents. CREATING A PROFILE, SUBMITTING ANY INFORMATION RELATING TO A POSSIBLE JOB OPPORTUNITY, MAKING ANY APPLICATION(S), OR ALLOWING SOMEONE ELSE (SUCH AS A RECRUITER) TO DO THAT FOR YOU, WILL BE YOUR CONSENT TO OUR TERMS OF USE, INCLUDING OUR PRIVACY POLICY AND THIS SUPPLEMENTAL POLICY.\n",
      "If you are a recruiter, friend or someone other than job applicant (\"Applicant\"), you represent and warrant to the Foundation that you have shown the Applicant the Terms of Use (including the Privacy Policy and Jobs Policy) and that you have obtained written consent from the Applicant to those terms and policies or that you are otherwise authorized to do so and to submit personal information about Applicant.\n",
      "Information That We Collect in Jobs. In addition to the personal information that we collect on the Site generally, in the Jobs section you may set up a \"profile\" which will require you to supply your email address and create a password and secret question to allow you to access your profile later. When you create a profile, submit an application, or authorize us to obtain a \"consumer report\" (such as a background check), we tend to collect this kind of information: name, address, telephone number, resume', employment, compensation and educational history, previous grants from us, social security number (or national insurance number for an Applicant based in the UK or other local equivalent) and so on. We keep track of when applications are submitted and persons using your password can see several months of that history by clicking on \"My Jobs\" if you have a profile.\n",
      "The information submitted about an Applicant online tends to be preliminary information. If we think there might be a good fit for a position, we often will ask the Applicant to complete a more formal application and also to authorize us to obtain a \"consumer report\" or \"consumer investigative report.\" Under U.S. law, a \"consumer report\" is a report bearing on credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living which is expected to be used or collected to serve as a factor in establishing Applicant's eligibility for employment. An \"investigative consumer report\" tends to be the same thing but the information is obtained through personal interviews with neighbors, friends, associates or acquaintances etc. of the Applicant. Both kinds of reports (or other information we collect) can include information from court, administrative and criminal records.\n",
      "Access to Information. You may update your profile personal information by using that Site functionality in the Jobs section. The foundation retains profiles in accordance with our records retention policy. We reserve the right to delete them and other information stored by or for you, so don’t store, for example, the only copy of a resume with us (and sometimes information will need to be re-entered). Profiles may be deleted at any time upon request by contacting us via our Write to Us form. Neither changes to or deletion of a profile will alter information already submitted or relied upon. \n",
      "How We Use Information Collected in Jobs. In addition to the uses of personal information allowed in the Privacy Policy, we make these kinds of uses of personal information submitted for a job. We Disclose it:\n",
      "If Applicant gets a job with us, we store the application and other information upon which we relied in Applicant’s personnel file and we may base post-employment decisions on it (including disciplinary actions).\n",
      "Passwords; Redact Your Resume. The Terms of Use require you to keep secret your password and other access credentials confidential. That's especially important if you don't want persons obtaining your password to be able to see any resume or a profile or to see other information available (e.g., positions for which applications have been made). Also, take steps to create a safe resume: before uploading a resume, remove any sensitive information such as social security numbers, identification numbers (e.g., driver's license), financial information, dates of birth etc. – we don't need or want that information in a resume.\n",

      "\t\t\n",
      "Poor nutrition contributes to nearly half of all child deaths under age 5 and impairs the physical and mental development of millions of children.\n",
      "More than 1 million child deaths could be averted each year by scaling up proven nutrition interventions.\n",
      "We work to broaden the use of proven interventions, such as breastfeeding, and we support the development and testing of new solutions.\n",
      "We work with other teams at the foundation—from Agricultural Development to Discovery & Translational Sciences—to broaden our collective learning and impact.\n",
      "Our Nutrition strategy is led by Shawn Baker, director, and is part of the foundation’s Global Development Division.\n",
      "Each year, millions of children die and many more suffer from physical and mental impairments due to poor nutrition during a critical 1,000-day period: from the onset of their mother’s pregnancy to their second birthday. Many children who live in poverty simply don’t get enough food—or the right kind of food—to support normal growth and development. Millions also suffer from illnesses such as diarrhea that sap the nutrients they consume. \n",
      "Nutrition-related factors contribute to about 45 percent of child deaths under age 5. Among undernourished children who survive, more than one quarter suffer from stunted growth, which can impair neurological development and learning.\n",
      "Nutrition has been a neglected area of global health and development, accounting for less than 1 percent of global foreign aid. This is largely due to its underlying and often hidden role in child illnesses and deaths. \n",
      "The problem starts before pregnancy. Women and girls who are not healthy and well-nourished are more likely to have malnourished children. Because poor nutrition compromises the immune system, children who are malnourished are more vulnerable to life-threatening infectious diseases as well as physical and cognitive impairments. This limits their ability to learn in school and reduces their productivity as adults—creating a vicious cycle that prevents families, communities, and countries from lifting themselves out of poverty.\n",
      "Most undernourished people live in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Ten countries in those regions account for two-thirds of deaths attributable to poor nutrition. But even in those countries, most people who are undernourished do not show symptoms of extreme hunger or starvation. This “hidden hunger” is invisible to families, communities, and policymakers, which means that nutrition does not get enough attention and national nutrition programs are often underfunded.\n",
      "Other challenges that contribute to malnutrition include inconsistent access to safe and affordable nutritious food; lack of awareness and understanding of healthy diets among those most at risk; low agricultural productivity (made worse by climate change); and poor sanitation and hygiene.\n",
      "Over the past decade, research has dramatically expanded our understanding of how to improve nutrition for women and children. We now know, for example, that it is critical to reach children within the 1,000-day period and reach mothers and adolescent girls before, during, and after pregnancy. \n",
      "A number of nutrition interventions have been shown to significantly improve child health and survival. They include exclusive breastfeeding during the first 6 months of life, fortifying staple foods such as cereal flours and cooking oil and iodizing salt, breeding crops for improved nutritional content, and providing micronutrient supplements (such as vitamin A and zinc) to children and providing iron and folic acid to mothers before and during pregnancy and while breastfeeding.\n",
      "In places where these interventions have been broadly used, the results have been striking. In Brazil, for example, efforts to improve and align nutrition and agriculture interventions reduced stunting by 80 percent within a generation. In Vietnam, rates of exclusive breastfeeding have tripled since 2009 as a result of focused efforts to support mothers. Vitamin A supplementation, which helps reduce blindness and childhood death, is now reaching more than 70 percent of children in high-risk countries. \n",
      "These tools must be scaled up to reach all mothers and children. At the same time, new solutions are also needed. Evidence suggests that fully scaling up current interventions would address only about half of the burden of malnutrition because of its complex causes.\n",
      "We invest in proven approaches to improving nutrition, such as focusing on the 1,000-day window, immediate and exclusive breastfeeding, complementary feeding, and food fortification and supplementation. We also explore new approaches, such as improving nutrition for women and adolescent girls, increasing advocacy and technical assistance, improving data systems, and strengthening food systems.\n",
      "A new sweet potato variety that is rich in vitamin A is now widely available in eastern and southern Africa.\n",
      "Our long-term goals are to prevent 1.8 million malnutrition-related deaths by 2020 and to develop and test new solutions to address the burden of malnutrition that cannot be alleviated using existing interventions. \n",
      "We work closely with governments, the United Nations, bilateral agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and the private sector, and we collaborate with other teams within the foundation—from Agricultural Development to Discovery & Translational Sciences—to broaden our collective learning and impact.\n",
      "Proper nutrition from birth to age 2 is critical to a child’s growth and development and lifelong health. (Photo © Alive & Thrive/Tina Sanghvi)\n",
      "The cornerstone of our strategy is our partnerships with several high-burden countries—Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, India (with a focus on Bihar and Uttar Pradesh), and Nigeria—to demonstrate what can be achieved by expanding the use of proven interventions and developing and introducing new solutions. \n",
      "In each country, we work with partners to show how these interventions can be introduced and expanded in specific contexts. We also work closely with key partners—including Alive & Thrive, Helen Keller International, HarvestPlus, and the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN)—to apply successful approaches and practices to other countries. \n",
      "Despite significant research in the past few decades, knowledge about the immediate and underlying causes of unhealthy growth and development remains incomplete. We invest in research to understand the full range of causes of malnutrition, identify the right packages of interventions, and establish the best times to intervene.\n",
      "We work closely with leading universities—including Cornell University; Johns Hopkins University; Oxford University; University of California, Davis; and University of Colorado—to develop, test, and roll out new solutions and address the obstacles to effective implementation, particularly barriers to reaching women and girls and addressing social and gender norms.\n",
      "A women’s self-help group in a remote region of Rajasthan, India, produces fortified foods for distribution to mothers and young children. (Photo © Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition)\n",
      "Despite recent agricultural innovations, the current food system is not capable of delivering good nutrition to all. Improving nutrition and addressing dietary deficiencies requires changes across the entire food chain—from how food is produced to how it is sold and consumed. \n",
      "We work with national governments—particularly ministries of agriculture and health—to strengthen food systems by increasing collaboration between the agriculture and nutrition sectors; improving production and delivery of nutritious foods; using market-oriented approaches to ensuring the safety and affordability of nutritious foods; and empowering women to expand their control of resources in the home. \n",
      "Better data is needed to define the problem of malnutrition, diagnose its root causes, design interventions, and track progress. In particular, many countries lack the data they need to measure progress against global nutrition targets. \n",
      "We are developing new tools and platforms to enable timely collection of data and improve its analysis and use. We also support global efforts to standardize the collection and monitoring of nutrition data and use evidence to develop effective policies and guidelines.\n",
      "Less than 1 percent of global foreign aid is currently directed toward nutrition; national budget allocations in high-burden countries are similarly low. We work to increase domestic and donor resources for nutrition and to improve coordination to achieve long-term impact.\n",
      "We work with leading organizations—including 1,000 Days, the Global Nutrition Report, Save the Children, Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN), Graça Machel Trust, and Action Against Hunger (Action Contre La Faim)—to generate better nutrition-related evidence, policies, and advocacy efforts at the global level and in high-burden countries. By encouraging greater investment and more effective spending and donor coordination, we aim to build the political will that is needed to reduce malnutrition globally.\n",

      "                We believe that all lives have equal value, and that by working together we can help reduce inequality and poverty. In collaboration with our partners, we are working to improve the lives of more than a billion people in India by addressing challenges\n",
      " related to health, sanitation, access to financial services, and agricultural development.\n",
      "            \n",
      "India is investing significantly in the health and social development of its people, working to enable millions of people to participate in the country’s growth and economic progress. At the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, all of our efforts are aligned with India’s objectives - working closely with India’s central and state governments, we partner with community groups, nonprofit organizations, academic institutions, the private sector, and development organizations, to achieve our shared goals. \n",
      "With a particular focus on Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, we develop innovative solutions to improve the quality and coverage of key services.\n",
      "Our core work in the country is across four sectors: Health, Sanitation, Agricultural Development, and Financial Services for the Poor.\n",
      "A hallmark of India's investment in its development is the thoughtful application of scientific and technological advances to meet the needs of the poorest populations. In New Delhi last November, Bill Gates explained why he is \"an optimist about India.\" The country, he told the National Institute for Transforming India, is \"taking technology, including digital technology, and using it\" to \"write a new chapter in the history books about how a people and country can rise to big challenges.\" This letter is about some of the ways in which India is doing this and how the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is collaborating with local institutions to support these efforts, in our own small way.\n",
      "Over the years, the Gates Foundation has learned a lot about how to be an effective partner. We understand India's scale and diversity and know that we don't have the resources to support multiple programs here on our own. We also recognize India's complexity and know that the most reliable and sustainable solutions are best provided by local champions who've spent their careers working in India. For this reason, we rarely initiate programs from scratch, instead partnering with leaders and communities and striving to add value as they take on big health and development challenges.\n",
      "Sometimes the Gates Foundation contributes expertise. We know the issues and key players and can help connect the right people and resources. At other times we contribute data. We quickly set up pilot projects to test and refine a strategy, and provide decision-makers with examples and evidence. We also help facilitate important relationships across traditional boundaries so that governments, non-governmental organizations and private sector companies can collaborate to deliver innovations faster to those in need. The investments we make fill gaps and help good ideas become lifesaving solutions.\n",
      "What follows are four stories of how we're doing this – in close collaboration with partners across the country – as India strives to attain the Sustainable Development Goals.\n",
      "Through the Swachh Bharat Mission, the Government of India has made a strong commitment to end open defecation. This is a vital initiative because bacteria, parasites and viruses in fecal waste matter are responsible for the deaths of over 200,000 children each year as well as the chronic poor health of many more children and adults. While ending open defecation is an extremely important and challenging first step, it is just one component in comprehensively addressing the sanitation problem. Treating fecal waste and disposing of it safely are critical steps toward ensuring safe sanitation for entire communities.\n",
      "Today, close to 70% of the human waste generated across India seeps into the environment untreated. While cities such as Indore and Nashik are addressing sanitation holistically, most urban and rural areas in India have been unable to do this successfully. Fully centralized sewerage systems are prohibitively expensive propositions, due in large part to the high cost of water and energy. Indeed, they're no longer the only recommended solutions for modern cities.\n",
      "Decentralized, non-sewered sanitation solutions have a bigger role to play in most urban areas, given that more than 70% of households use onsite sanitation containment systems such as septic tanks and pit latrines. These solutions can be sized to local needs, with smaller infrastructure footprints and affordable capital-and operating-expenditures.\n",
      "To demonstrate the viability of such solutions, in 2014 the Gates Foundation helped a sanitation company build and fine-tune the first community fecal sludge treatment plant (FSTP) in Devanahalli, near Bangalore city. In less than a year, the amount of waste being treated in Devanahalli increased from 0 to 40 percent. The plant separates liquid from solid waste, treats both to remove pathogens and produces compost and water that are safe for agricultural use.\n",
      "The plant uses relatively basic technology but is configured ingeniously so it can be sized to meet the needs of the community it serves, gives off no odour whatsoever and uses no electricity—it is powered by gravity, for the most part. Thanks to its intentional design, the plant is relatively inexpensive to build and run, which makes the cost-benefit analysis clear to state governments and municipalities considering making similar investments of their own.\n",
      "\n",
      "FSTPs are currently being built in Odisha. Officials in Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, UP and Bihar are planning the build-out of similar plants. By 2020, we expect there to be more than 25 such plants supporting sanitation across India, in towns and cities with populations as small as 20,000 and those that are over a million strong.\n",
      "The powerful, nearly ubiquitous mobile phone is helping the government make great strides in improving health systems. At the request of the Ministry for Women and Child Development, the Gates Foundation worked with a partner to develop and roll out the ministry's new Common Application Software (CAS). CAS is changing the way Anganwadi workers help mothers keep their children healthy and well-nourished. Currently, health workers have to enter information into 11 different registers – a painstaking, time-intensive, clumsy process.\n",
      "Using CAS, each Anganwadi worker can immediately enter clients' health information into her mobile device, at which point it is uploaded to a central database and is immediately useful. Nearly 50,000 AWWs are now using CAS in five states – and the scale-up continues. Information about the health of nearly 4 million women and children has already started to come in, providing an invaluable view of their growth and nutritional status. By 2020, all 1.4 million Anganwadi workers across India will be using the system.\n",
      "It isn't only Anganwadi workers who can now track real-time information about the health needs of their communities. Decision-makers are also able to monitor districts and regions and see at-a-glance when urgent intervention or additional resources are needed.\n",
      "A mobile phone-based system is also transforming the way India monitors and replenishes vaccine supplies in the country's health centers. The accuracy of old-fashioned paper records was unreliable, and because information took weeks to reach central offices, no one knew how long stock-outs might last or when faulty equipment would be working again. Now, thanks to the mobile-based electronic vaccination intelligence network (eVIN), many of the weaknesses inherent in the paper-based system are gone.\n",
      "eVIN was created by the government in collaboration with a software company and several NGOs, including the Gates Foundation. Sensors in refrigerators and freezers automatically inform a central database when temperatures change, signaling that the equipment needs to be repaired or replaced. Managers at vaccination locations enter data as soon as vaccines are delivered, providing a global view of the supply situation. In the past, district-level administrators were unable to move supplies within their systems: if a health center had a stock-out, it had to be re-supplied from a central location. Now, workers can identify overstocked centers nearby and quickly shift the excess supplies as eVIN tracks their transit and temperature. The technology even works well in low-resource network settings.\n",
      "Stock-outs have fallen by half in states where eVIN is in place, and it may soon be deployed for other medicines. The system has been so successful that other countries, including the Philippines, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Nepal and Thailand, are looking at it.\n",
      "Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) or Elephantiasis (Hathi Paon) is an ancient and neglected disease in India. Over 650 million Indians are currently at risk of contracting this disease, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). It causes painful, disabling swelling. People who present symptoms suffer from terrible social stigma. India has set a goal to eliminate LF by 2020. One of the main strategies for eliminating LF is preventative mass-drug-administration (MDA). The current MDA regimen utilizes two drugs, Albendazole and Diethylcarbamazine Citrate (DEC), to eliminate the parasite from the blood streams of infected individuals. Yet the goal of elimination remains elusive, mainly because the MDAs often don't reach enough affected individuals.\n",
      "Over the years, the Gates Foundation has been working with key development partners to strengthen India's LF program. In 2015 we supported the Death to Onchocerciasis and Lymphatic Filariasis (DOLF) project, which discovered that in Co'te d'Ivoire and Papua New Guinea the addition of a third drug, Ivermectin, made the combination treatment regimen much more effective. Evidence showed that a single dose of the triple-drug therapy – Ivermectin, DEC and Albendazole (IDA) almost entirely eliminated the parasite from a patient's blood.\n",
      "Based on this data, in 2016 we partnered with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and other organizations, including the WHO, to establish the three-drug regimen's efficacy and safety. Following extensive study in India's population, the new regime's safety has been established and the Government of India plans to introduce IDA as a key therapeutic strategy in future MDAs. National and global elimination of this dreaded disease is in sight, thanks to innovation and testing.\n",
      "The country is focusing on adapting cutting-edge technologies so they contribute to progress on the most challenging issues facing the poor. The combination of taking smart risks to devise new solutions and showing the will to invest in improving lives is unprecedented.\n",
      "India is making great strides in science and technology that can and will transform communities at home and globally. At the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, we admire the scale and scope of the country's ambitions and feel privileged to have the opportunity to help catalyze this vision into concrete results for all.\n",

      "\t\t\tChildren crossing the border from Pakistan to Afghanistan are given oral polio vaccine through a program implemented by Rotary International.\r\n",
      "\t\t\n",
      "In 1988, when the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) was launched, polio was present in more than 125 countries and paralyzed about 1,000 children per day. Thanks to immunization efforts that have reached nearly 3 billion children, the incidence of polio has decreased by 99 percent since then.\n",
      "India, which was long considered the most difficult place to end the disease, hasn’t reported a polio case since 2011. Today, polio is found only in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Nigeria.\n",
      "Despite this progress, if we fail to completely eradicate the disease, we could witness a resurgence of 200,000 new cases annually, making this a critical priority in global health.\n",
      "The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is committed to eradicating polio worldwide, and that’s why we are a key supporter and partner of the GPEI.\n",
      "Over the past three decades, the world has made tremendous progress toward the eradication of polio. In 1988—when wild poliovirus was present in more than 125 countries and paralyzed 350,000 people every year, primarily young children—the World Health Assembly set a goal to eliminate the disease, and the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) was launched. Since then, immunization efforts have reduced the number of cases by more than 99 percent, saving more than 13 million children from paralysis. India stopped the virus in 2011, and  today, polio is found only in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria. In 2016, there were fewer than 40 cases reported globally.\n",
      "Despite this progress, if we fail to fully eradicate this highly contagious disease, within a decade, we could witness a resurgence of as many as 200,000 new cases annually. Since 2008, more than 20 countries have experienced polio outbreaks—some of them multiple times. Efforts to reach unvaccinated children are often hampered by security risks and geographic and cultural barriers. Furthermore, vaccination campaigns cost approximately US$1 billion per year, a price that is not sustainable over the long term.\n",
      "At the World Health Assembly in 2012, 194 member states declared that the eradication of polio is a “programmatic emergency for global public health.” At the 2013 Global Vaccine Summit in Abu Dhabi, donors pledged $4 billion to fund GPEI’s new six-year plan to eradicate polio and eliminate the disease. Experts estimate that in the two decades following eradication, countries will receive between US$40 billion and US$50 billion in net benefits, approximately 85 percent of which will go to low-income countries. This figure does not include additional health improvements resulting from other GPEI efforts, such as vitamin A supplementation or the much larger net benefits of eradication for countries that eliminated polio before the GPEI started.\n",
      "India—long considered the most difficult place to end polio due to its population density, high migration rates, poor sanitation, high birth rates, and low rates of routine immunization—is a prime example of how a fully funded program with dedicated leaders and workers can achieve success.\n",
      "Polio vaccination teams pick up supplies at a railway station in the state of Bihar in northern India.\n",
      "A number of factors contributed to India’s success: highly targeted, data-driven planning; well-trained and motivated staff; rigorous monitoring; effective communications; mobilization of trusted community and religious leaders; political will at all levels; and adequate funding. India has served as a model for other regions and has shared technical assistance and best practices with countries including Nigeria, Afghanistan, and Pakistan.\n",
      "Global collaboration and innovation have produced new tools and approaches that can help improve logistical planning for polio eradication. In addition, refinements to the polio vaccine have improved the immune response to the remaining types of the disease. (Wild type 2 poliovirus was eliminated in 1999, and wild type 3 has not been reported anywhere since 2012.) New diagnostic, monitoring, mapping, and modeling tools are allowing faster and more accurate tracking of polio cases and transmission patterns.\n",
      "To slow the spread of polio in their countries, Nigeria, Pakistan and Afghanistan have implemented national emergency plans overseen by their heads of state. These programs increase accountability and improve the quality of polio vaccination campaigns from the national to the local level. WHO is providing unprecedented levels of technical assistance to these countries, and improved vaccination campaigns are helping reach more children.\n",
      "The GPEI six-year plan serves as the basis for all activities required to stop polio, including the use of data and analysis to set country-level vaccination targets, as well as the use of new tools and approaches to implement programs. According to a 2015 midterm review, the GPEI program is largely on track but will need an additional US$1.5 billion to fund the program through 2019.\n",
      "Eradicating polio is an important milestone for the Decade of Vaccines, a shared commitment by nearly 200 countries to extend the benefits of vaccines to every person by 2020. It also would establish a model we could use to deliver vaccines for other preventable diseases and protect children in the poorest, least accessible areas.\n",
      "Polio eradication is one of our top priorities, and as a major supporter of the GPEI, we contribute technical and financial resources to accelerate targeted vaccination campaigns, community mobilization, and routine immunizations. We also partner to improve polio surveillance and outbreak response; develop safer, more effective vaccines; and galvanize financial and political support for polio eradication efforts.\n",
      "We have a unique ability to contribute by taking big risks and making nontraditional investments. Examples include our investments in vaccine research; our funding of geographic information system (GIS) maps to replace hand-drawn maps for campaign planning; and our establishment of emergency operations centers in Nigeria, Pakistan, and Afghanistan.\n",
      "Through improvements in outreach, staffing, and data collection and analysis, polio vaccination campaigns can achieve the required immunization coverage to reach GPEI goals. Our priority is to improve the quality of campaigns in Nigeria, Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as other countries that are at risk of polio importation. As the program nears eradication, it’s more important than ever that countries keep high-quality campaigns going, even if they do not have active cases.\n",
      "Children receiving oral polio vaccine at an event inaugurating a polio vaccination campaign in Kano, Nigeria.\n",
      "GPEI’s polio eradication strategy focuses on national and local campaigns that provide all children in the highest-risk countries with multiple doses of oral polio vaccine. Efforts include door-to-door immunization in areas where poliovirus is known or suspected, as well as in areas at risk of re-importation, with limited access to healthcare, high population density and mobility, poor sanitation, and low routine immunization coverage.\n",
      "We support work to understand social, cultural, political, and religious barriers to improving vaccination coverage, and we seek ways to work with local political leaders and health professionals. We also prioritize expanded staffing and training of vaccination teams, as well as greater technical assistance.\n",
      "We promote the use of sophisticated mapping tools to identify households in villages and help vaccination teams locate children who have not yet been reached. Such tools also help vaccination teams identify nomadic populations.\n",
      "Currently, 20 percent of the world’s children do not receive all the immunizations they need. Reaching every community requires understanding local barriers to access as well as the use of sophisticated tracking and planning tools. A coordinated immunization system can also serve as a platform for other important health interventions. We are working with our partners to strengthen routine immunization programs for polio and other preventable diseases, including diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, and measles.\n",
      "It is essential to pinpoint where and how the wild poliovirus is still circulating, and to verify eradication. A strong surveillance system helps us accurately target campaigns, adjust programs quickly, and swiftly address outbreaks.\n",
      "Polio surveillance is especially challenging because only a small percentage of infections result in clinically apparent paralytic disease. To confirm the disease, we must analyze stool specimens to see if poliovirus is present.\n",
      "Through our investments to evaluate surveillance efforts in the highest-risk areas, we have discovered the need for improved environmental surveillance: testing sewage water samples for evidence of poliovirus transmission in the surrounding community. We have invested in a technology that promises more sensitive sampling with lower specimen volume, as well as more hygienic collection. We also fund efforts to develop less expensive and more reliable lab tools, such as a diagnostic kit that local labs can use to rule out negative samples and send positive specimens to reference labs for confirmation.\n",
      "Although current vaccines and detection tools have proven highly effective in eliminating the virus from most countries, they may not completely eradicate the disease. We are working with partners to improve existing tools while accelerating the development of safer vaccines, better diagnostic tools, new antiviral drugs, and other products. We also work with partners, suppliers, and governments to ensure sufficient vaccine supply and demand and to promote market competition.\n",
      "The oral polio vaccine, which is most commonly used in the developing world, is safe, effective, easy to administer, and inexpensive. But this vaccine consists of live, weakened viruses, which in very rare cases can cause paralysis. In settings with very low oral polio vaccine coverage, the live weakened virus in the vaccine can also mutate and begin to circulate in the population. We are supporting the development of new oral polio vaccine formulations that do not pose this risk. We are also transitioning from using the oral vaccine to the injectable inactivated polio vaccine, which does not carry the same risk. We assist in efforts to lower the cost of the injectable vaccine and implement the training, supply, delivery, and communications infrastructure to expand its use.\n",
      "Data collection and sharing are critical to eradicating polio. We work to improve data access to inform decision-making, track progress, improve environmental surveillance, and guide the development of vaccines and diagnostic tools. We are also working with partners to develop a decision framework that identifies key decision areas, the data needed to inform decisions, and the staff and partners needed to analyze the data and create models. We support a data-access platform at WHO that ensures key polio data are standardized, quality-assured, and available for analysis and decision-making.\n",
      "Once wild poliovirus transmission has stopped globally, it will be important to ensure safe handling and containment of materials in laboratory and vaccine-production facilities. Reintroduction of the wild poliovirus would present the potentially serious consequences of re-establishing the disease. As part of the GPEI partnership, we are developing a post-eradication containment policy that will be adopted by the World Health Assembly.\n",
      "In its two decades of operation, the GPEI has trained and mobilized millions of staff and volunteers, identified and reached households and communities that had been untouched by other initiatives, and established a robust global surveillance and response system.\n",
      "Through polio eradication efforts, GPEI partners have learned how to overcome logistical, geographic, social, political, cultural, ethnic, gender, financial, and other barriers to working with people in the poorest and least accessible areas. The fight against polio has created new ways of addressing human health in the developing world—through political engagement, funding, planning and management strategies, research, and more.\n",
      "The GPEI has developed a wide range of assets, including detailed knowledge of high-risk groups and migration patterns; effective planning and monitoring procedures; highly trained technical staff; local and regional technical advisory bodies; and commitments based on successful partnerships among global, national, religious, and local leaders. These assets have already been used to respond to other public health threats, including Ebola, meningitis in western and central Africa, H1N1 flu in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Asian subcontinent, and flooding and tsunami disasters in South Asia.\n",
      "We are continuing to work with the GPEI to identify ways the polio infrastructure—including supply chains, surveillance and laboratory systems, and social mobilization networks—can be used to support other health initiatives and immunization programs in the long term.\n",
      "We work closely with GPEI partners to mobilize funding and sustained global and national political momentum for polio eradication. This involves promoting efforts to increase polio funding from government donors and cultivating new and nontraditional donors. We also encourage leaders of polio-affected countries to follow through on their commitments to ongoing campaigns, and we help them identify and implement sources of financing for those campaigns.\n",
      "We also align and mobilize other advocates, including influential community members such as religious leaders, volunteer organizations, and employers. With partners such as Rotary International, UNICEF, RESULTS, the UN Foundation, and the Global Poverty Project, we use traditional and social media to raise awareness of polio eradication and immunization activities in both donor countries and countries where polio is a threat. We support efforts to tailor communications to particular social, cultural, and political contexts to build demand for vaccination and to dispel myths about the safety and efficacy of vaccines.\n",

      "\t\t\n",
      " In the developing world, 2.5 billion people practice open defecation or lack adequate sanitation facilities; an additional 2.1 billion urban residents use facilities that do not safely dispose of human waste. \n",
      "Improved sanitation—including waste treatment and resource recovery—is essential to a healthy and sustainable future for the developing world. \n",
      "The foundation focuses on groundbreaking innovations in sanitation technology and new ways to deliver sanitation products and services, particularly in densely populated areas of South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. \n",
      "Our Water, Sanitation & Hygiene strategy is led by Brian Arbogast, director, and is part of the foundation’s Global Development Division. \n",
      "The need for better sanitation in the developing world is clear. Forty percent of the world’s population—2.5 billion people—practice open defecation or lack adequate sanitation facilities, and the consequences can be devastating for human health as well as the environment. Even in urban areas, where household and communal toilets are more prevalent, over 2 billion people use toilets connected to septic tanks that are not safely emptied or use other systems that discharge raw sewage into open drains or surface waters.\n",
      "Poor sanitation contributes to about 700,000 child deaths from diarrhea each year. Chronic diarrhea can hinder child development by impeding the absorption of essential nutrients and reducing the effectiveness of life-saving vaccines. \n",
      "Creating sanitation infrastructure and public services that work for everyone and that keep waste out of the environment is a major challenge. The toilets, sewers, and wastewater treatment systems used in the developed world require vast amounts of land, energy, and water, and they are expensive to build, maintain and operate. Existing alternatives that are less expensive are often unappealing because they don’t kill disease-causing pathogens, have impractical designs, or retain odors and attract insects.\n",
      "By improving how we deal with human waste, we can save lives, improve child health, and ensure greater dignity, privacy, and personal safety, particularly for women and girls. Better sanitation also contributes to economic development, delivering up to $5 in social and economic benefits for every $1 invested through increased productivity, reduced healthcare costs, and prevention of illness, disability, and early death.  \n",
      "Solving the sanitation challenge in the developing world will require radically new innovations that are deployable on a large scale. Innovation is especially needed in densely populated areas, where billions of people are only capturing and storing their waste, with no sustainable way to handle it once their on-site storage—such as a septic tank or latrine pit—fills up.\n",
      "Groundbreaking improvements in toilet design, pit emptying, and sludge treatment, as well as new ways to reuse waste, can help governments and their partners meet the enormous challenge of providing quality public sanitation services.\n",
      "The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation’s Water, Sanitation & Hygiene program focuses on developing innovative approaches and technologies that can lead to radical and sustainable improvements in sanitation in the developing world. \n",
      "A sanitation facility in the Kibera slum in Nairobi, Kenya, that was built by a public-private partnership to improve urban sanitation.\n",
      "This requires understanding issues across the entire sanitation service chain, including waste containment (toilets), emptying (of pits and septic tanks), transportation (to sewage treatment facilities), waste treatment, and disposal/reuse.\n",
      "Because the innovations we support can be most immediately valuable in densely populated areas, our main focus is on urban sanitation. Our priorities include developing non-sewered sanitation approaches, identifying new delivery models, and advocating for public policies that support improved sanitation in densely populated areas.\n",
      "Ultimately, better sanitation will be a key to ensuring healthy, sustainable cities in the developing world, and the approaches that prove successful can be adapted and extended to rural communities.\n",
      "We support many clean water and hygiene projects that have and will deliver significant results, but sanitation is our top priority because we have identified it as a neglected area in which we can spur significant change.\n",
      "Most of our sanitation projects are in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, where the burden of inadequate sanitation is greatest.\n",
      "We focus our grantmaking in five complementary areas: transformative technologies, urban sanitation markets, building demand for sanitation, policy and advocacy, and monitoring and evaluation. \n",
      "A key part of our effort to radically improve sanitation in the developing world is our Reinvent the Toilet Challenge (RTTC). We are funding research to develop truly aspirational “next-generation” toilets that do not require a sewer or water connection or electricity, cost less than 5 cents per user per day, and are designed to meet people’s needs. Most of the projects use chemical engineering processes for energy and resource recovery from human waste.\n",
      "A prototype toilet designed by Loughborough University researchers that extracts biological charcoal, minerals, and clean water from human waste.\n",
      "Since 2011, we have awarded 16 RTTC grants to research organizations around the world. In 2013, we launched two country-specific RTTC programs in India and China. Both of these programs are designed to harness strong in-country research and development capabilities to solve this global challenge.\n",
      "At the same time, we are developing market-driven ways to stop the dumping of fecal sludge into the environment. The Omni-Ingestor program is developing technologies to make servicing and maintenance of existing sanitation infrastructure—including latrine pits and septic tanks—easier and more affordable for private companies, public utilities, and municipalities. The Omni-Processor program is developing low-cost approaches for processing fecal sludge and the combined processing of fecal sludge and solid waste. The goal is to develop processors that are smaller than traditional treatment plants, with each processor supporting some 100,000 residents. Ideally, processed waste will be converted into products, forms of energy, or fertilizers and other soil amendments, which can generate revenue and thereby offset waste collection costs and increase people’s standard of living.\n",
      "New sanitation technologies require new market structures and service models. In key urban markets, we are testing innovative approaches for their appeal to people in real-world settings. We are also working with local governments, service providers, and community-based organizations to foster a policy and regulatory environment that supports the use of new sanitation products and delivery methods. \n",
      "These toilets in the slums of Nairobi, Kenya, are distributed through local entrepreneurs, who collect the waste for use in generating electricity and producing fertilizer.\n",
      "We see particular promise in approaches that allow private-sector providers to profit from byproducts that have market value, including energy and fertilizer generated from fecal sludge. We recognize that in the near term, such revenues may not fully cover collection and treatment costs or generate traditional rates of return, so the public sector will continue to have an important role to play—not only to provide regulation and oversight but also to supply some of the services. \n",
      "A household toilet built as part of a community sanitation project in Badsu village in Himachal Pradesh, northern India.\n",
      "In addition to investing in improved technologies and urban market conditions, we support initiatives that help stimulate user demand for improved sanitation. Part of this effort involves working with sanitation providers and partners to help them adopt more evidence-based practices so they can deliver sanitation services that meet people’s needs. It also includes promoting incremental shifts in social norms around toilet use that will lead to higher demand for better sanitation products and services as they become available.\n",
      "We work to improve the policy and regulatory environment for sanitation through partnerships with all levels of governments, multilateral organizations, community-based nongovernmental organizations, service providers, and others. \n",
      "We invest in monitoring and evaluation to understand the effectiveness of various sanitation approaches. We use this information to report on our progress, assess the impact of our grantmaking, and share lessons that we learn with our partners.\n",

      "The Development Policy and Finance team works with partners to understand the impact of policies and financing decisions that affect international health and development and to propose new ideas that could speed progress.\n",
      "We make grants to research and policy institutions, nongovernmental organizations, and health and finance experts to develop evidence, ideas, and innovations that could transform policymaking and ultimately improve lives.\n",
      "We provide independent analysis and recommendations to foundation leaders on critical policy and financing issues that are relevant to the foundation’s work.\n",
      "Our Development Policy and Finance strategy is led by Gargee Ghosh, director, and is part of the foundation’s Global Policy & Advocacy Division.\n",
      "Improving the lives of the world’s poorest people requires significant financial commitments and spending available funding in the most effective and creative ways possible. We believe that this challenge demands more than business as usual on the part of the major public, private, and nongovernmental entities that support the fight against extreme poverty and health inequities around the world.\n",
      "Global ambition to eradicate extreme poverty—and the inequities that go with it—has rarely been higher. Funders, including the foundation, are eager to work with countries, technical experts, civil society organizations, and citizens to deliver on that vision, and all of these parties are hungry for the data, analysis, innovation, and ideas that will help make it a reality.\n",

      "The Development Policy and Finance team supports research and analysis that can lead to new policy ideas and financing innovations. We also draw on the foundation’s own evidence and experiences to help our internal teams advance their work in policy and financing.\n",
      "Our team works with donor governments, developing country governments, multilateral development banks, and other development experts. We also make grants to research and policy institutions, including universities and think tanks. We use the foundation’s convening ability and leadership voice to support our partners’ analysis and ideas and to support the launch of promising innovations.\n",
      "For example, we helped convene an independent commission of 25 leading economists and health experts—led by former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and University of Washington Professor of Global Health Dean Jamison—to develop an investment framework for achieving major gains in global health. The Lancet Commission on Investing in Health’s report, “Global Health 2035: A World Converging within a Generation,” offers a plan to reduce deaths from infectious disease and maternal and child mortality to universally low levels while yielding a huge economic return on investment, by doubling global health spending within the context of smart fiscal policies, effective interventions, and new tools.\n",
      "Improving the effectiveness of development aid requires understanding policies and funding portfolios, analyzing what works, and contributing new ideas. We work with donors and other development partners, global advocates, think tanks, and multilateral organizations such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to modernize development aid systems, unlock more funding, and get more value from each aid dollar spent. This work includes developing and championing structures to support innovation and research.\n",
      "We work closely with the World Bank and regional development banks, including the African Development Bank, on common agendas in health and development as well as financing innovations. We also provide support to think tanks and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to conduct research and develop ideas in areas such as the new geography of poverty and the need for smooth transitions from concessional to domestic and non-concessional resources, the updating of poverty numbers, and innovative multilateral financing instruments. Within the foundation, we help program teams navigate their relationships with multilateral development banks and design new partnerships to help them achieve their strategic goals.\n",
      "Domestic resources outweigh all other funding—including foreign aid—in most developing countries. We work with countries to analyze their spending on health and poverty and to develop data, analysis, and ideas to advance progress toward their human development and equity goals. Our work includes a partnership with the African Development Bank to create a policy toolkit that helps African countries direct resources from new oil, mineral, and gas discoveries toward human development; supporting analysis of the equity of tax systems in Africa; and building a database to track country expenditures within the social sectors. Key partners in this effort include national governments, multilateral institutions, regional and international think tanks and advocacy groups, and local NGOs.\n",

      "Why did the Gates Foundation build the Discovery Center?\n",
      "The Discovery Center aims to motivate and inspire people to take action—in their own unique ways—to improve the lives of others. Through displays, interactive exhibits, and programs, we work to spark conversation about global and local issues and highlight the important progress being made in Seattle and around the world. We designed the Discovery Center as a place where people can share ideas, explore their interests, and experience the power of optimism about the world’s future.\n",
      "Do I need to schedule a visit? \n",
      "You can drop in any time the Discovery Center is open (Tues-Sat, 10am to 5pm; until 6pm June 3-August 30) to explore our galleries on your own. If you’d like a guided tour, please book a tour at least 2 weeks in advance.\n",
      "How long are the guided tours? \n",
      "Tours are 60 to 90 minutes long and include a guided portion as well as time for independent exploration. \n",
      "How small or large can my tour group be? \n",
      "There is no minimum group size. We recommend groups of about 15 people, although we can accommodate as many as 75 visitors at a time. We divide larger groups into smaller tours, each with their own guide. If your group is larger than 75 people, we recommend a format that consists of an orientation talk followed by a self-guided visit.\n",
      "Where do I park?\n",
      "Paid parking is available in the adjoining Seattle Center Fifth Avenue Garage. Several nearby on-street parking options are also available. We do not have bus parking at the Discovery Center, but we can help arrange pick-up and drop-off points. Please note that we cannot validate parking.\n",
      "Can I reach the Discovery Center using public transportation? \n",
      "We are easily accessible via the Seattle Center Monorail and Metro buses 3 and 4.\n",
      "Is food available at the Discovery Center? \n",
      "Food and drinks are not sold or allowed in the Discovery Center, but your group can bring sack lunches to enjoy on the park-like grounds of Seattle Center. We are happy to keep your lunches in our storage room while you are at the Discovery Center. \n",
      "How often do exhibits change?\n",
      "Our main exhibits do not rotate frequently, but our interactive gallery is constantly being refreshed with new ideas, suggestions, and inventions from visitors. Repeat visits can inspire a deeper connection to the work we highlight!  \n",
      "Our theater hosts a continuously rotating slate of videos and presentations. We also host public events that build on the themes in our exhibits and show ways visitors can give back to their communities. \n",
      "May I visit the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation campus? \n",
      "The foundation campus is an active work space for nearly 1,000 foundation employees and is closed to the public. However, visitors can take a cell phone audio tour that takes you to vantage points with ample views into the campus. The tour is available 24/7 at (206) 577-3617. You’ll learn about the foundation’s history and programs as well as the campus design, sustainability features, and artwork. (An audio tour map is available at the Discovery Center.) \n",

      "We couldn’t agree more. Our foundation is teaming up with partners around the world to take on some tough challenges: extreme poverty and poor health in developing countries, and the failures of America’s education system. We focus on only a few issues because we think that’s the best way to have great impact, and we focus on these issues in particular because we think they are the biggest barriers that prevent people from making the most of their lives.\n",
      "For each issue we work on, we fund innovative ideas that could help remove these barriers: new techniques to help farmers in developing countries grow more food and earn more money; new tools to prevent and treat deadly diseases; new methods to help students and teachers in the classroom. Some of the projects we fund will fail. We not only accept that, we expect it—because we think an essential role of philanthropy is to make bets on promising solutions that governments and businesses can’t afford to make. As we learn which bets pay off, we have to adjust our strategies and share the results so everyone can benefit.\n",
      "We’re both optimists. We believe by doing these things—focusing on a few big goals and working with our partners on innovative solutions—we can help every person get the chance to live a healthy, productive life. \n",

      "\t\t\tBy immunizing children against pneumococcus in the world’s poorest countries, we can save the lives of millions of children.\n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t\n",
      "Pneumonia is the leading cause of death among children under age 5, with more than 99 percent of those deaths occurring in the developing world.\n",
      "Childhood deaths from pneumonia are preventable using existing vaccines, diagnostic tools, and treatments.\n",
      "We work to improve the development and delivery of pneumonia vaccines and expand the use of antibiotic treatments and diagnostic tools. \n",
      "We support the goals of the integrated Global Action Plan for Pneumonia and Diarrhoea (GAPPD), an effort led by the World Health Organization and UNICEF to accelerate disease prevention and control. \n",
      "Our Pneumonia strategy is led by Keith Klugman, Director of Pneumonia in the foundation’s Global Health Division.\n",
      "Even as global child deaths have declined from 12.6 million to 6.6 million over the last two decades, pneumonia has remained the world’s leading cause of death among children under age 5. Despite available interventions, pneumonia claimed the lives of 1.3 million children in 2011 and was responsible for 18 percent of child deaths worldwide—nearly all of them in developing countries, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.\n",
      "Because pneumonia can be caused by a number of viruses and bacteria, multiple interventions are needed to reduce childhood mortality from the disease. Effective vaccines are available for Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), the most common bacterial causes after the first month of life.  Some viral and bacterial pathogens, however, disproportionately kill infants before they can be immunized. \n",
      "Childhood deaths from pneumonia are preventable using vaccines, diagnostic tools, and treatments, but issues of availability, access, and cost remain obstacles in the developing world. Nearly half of early childhood deaths from pneumonia are estimated to result from lack of, or delay in appropriate diagnosis and treatment. In resource-limited settings, factors such as malnutrition, HIV infection, and indoor air pollution increase children’s risk of developing pneumonia. \n",
      "The global health community has adequate tools and is developing better ones to significantly protect children from pneumonia in the developing world. \n",
      "Vaccines have already helped to substantially reduce childhood pneumonia. But vaccine coverage must be improved, and lower-cost vaccines are needed where the burden of pneumonia is highest, particularly in India and Nigeria. Vaccinating women during pregnancy has the potential to protect young infants by passing natural antibodies from mother to her baby. This approach, maternal immunization, has yet to be widely implemented beyond prevention of neonatal tetanus. Creating some momentum recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended influenza vaccination for pregnant women as the focus of its strategy to prevent deaths from influenza. Early treatment is also critical. If properly diagnosed, childhood pneumonia can be effectively treated with a three-day course of antibiotics at a cost of only 21 to 42 U.S. cents. \n",
      "Fortunately, awareness of pneumonia as a major global health problem has increased. In 2013, WHO and UNICEF launched the integrated Global Action Plan for Pneumonia and Diarrhoea (GAPPD) to fight the diseases. The GAPPD calls for the use of proven interventions, including vaccination against measles, pertussis, pneumococcus, and Hib; exclusive breastfeeding in the first six months of life; and improved case management in communities.\n",
      "The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation’s pneumonia strategy broadly reflects the Protect, Prevent, Treat framework used by the GAPPD. We focus on the most prevalent causes of childhood pneumonia—the pneumococcus, influenza, and RSV—and we are continuing our longstanding investment in vaccines against meningococcus, which despite it not being a major cause of pneumonia, continues to cause epidemic meningitis. In addition, we are developing a platform for maternal immunization to protect mothers and their newborns from pathogens that bear a disproportionate mortality burden in the neonatal period, including RSV, influenza, pertussis, tetanus and the group B streptococcus.\n",
      "Our key partner in increasing access to pneumococcal vaccines is the GAVI Alliance, a public-private partnership that funds vaccines for children in the world’s poorest countries. By immunizing children against Hib and pneumococcus in these countries, we can save the lives of 2.9 million children and prevent 52 million cases of pneumonia. \n",
      "Our top priority is to promote full-scale delivery of currently available pneumococcal and meningococcal vaccines and to support the development of new vaccines to improve coverage, efficacy, safety, and cost effectiveness. \n",
      "Because vaccines cannot prevent all cases of pneumonia and because the incidence of this disease remains high, we also work to improve access to appropriate diagnostic and treatment options in public and private healthcare systems. Saving lives through improved access to diagnosis and treatment is particularly critical in countries where the introduction of vaccines is lagging. This includes interventions at multiple points in the continuum of care ranging from improving care-seeking practices to guiding informal care providers in appropriate disease management. \n",
      "Other priorities include improving the quality of pneumonia-related data collection, advocating for increased international funding, and researching the links between pneumonia and indoor air pollution.\n",
      " Our strategy complements efforts by several other foundation programs, including those for vaccine delivery; nutrition; maternal, newborn, and child health; and enteric and diarrheal diseases.\n",
      "Our work focuses on seven priority initiatives: pneumococcus, meningococcus, diagnosis and treatment, strategic information and advocacy, RSV, influenza, and risk factors. While pneumonia affects people of all ages, our priority is children under age 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pneumococcus is the leading cause of pneumonia and is responsible for at least 40 percent of cases in children under age 5. We work to broaden access to the two commercially available pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) while also investing in the development, regulatory approval, and deployment of newer and improved vaccines.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have worked with the GAVI Alliance to implement the Advance Market Commitment for Pneumococcal Vaccines, an innovative financing mechanism that accelerates late-stage development and manufacturing of pneumococcal vaccines for developing countries. In order to help lower the price of these costly vaccines, particularly for high-burden areas, we are working with PATH and the Serum Institute of India to develop and introduce additional pneumococcal conjugate vaccines to the market.\n",
      "In an effort to eliminate epidemic meningitis A in Africa, we support the Meningitis Vaccine Project, a collaboration that also includes PATH, WHO, African health ministers, and the Serum Institute of India. The project has developed an affordable vaccine called MenAfriVac—the first vaccine developed specifically for Africa—that provides lasting protection from life-threatening meningococcal meningitis, a bacterial infection of the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord.\n",
      "MenAfriVac was first introduced in Burkina Faso in 2010. Initial data from more than 100 million administered doses in Sub-Saharan Africa suggests that it is effective in reducing meningococcal A outbreaks; the meningitis A bacterium has been nearly eliminated in vaccinated populations so far. Our strategy supports efforts to make MenAfriVac available to infants, to promote its inclusion in routine immunization programs, and to monitor the evolution of the disease and the potential need for meningitis interventions beyond this new vaccine. \n",
      "Urgent work is needed to ensure that children who are sick with a severe respiratory illness receive appropriate care. Many children die because they are not able to receive appropriate care quickly. Children who do reach a provider might be misdiagnosed or not given the appropriate antibiotic, amoxicillin. Sometimes the provider might not recognize that the child’s condition is severe or that the child is at increased risk due to young age or malnutrition. In many instances, such cases require referral to a facility where supportive care interventions such as oxygen are available. \n",
      "We work closely with other teams at the foundation to improve access to effective treatment for children with pneumonia, with a special focus on Nigeria, northern India, Ethiopia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Pakistan—the countries with the greatest number of pneumonia deaths. Our work includes generating evidence to improve care for infants and children with pneumonia in limited-resource settings, advocating for policy changes and increased financial support to expand the availability of key treatment commodities (including amoxicillin DT, pulse oximetry, and oxygen), and demonstrating how appropriate pneumonia care reduces mortality in order to accelerate improvements in case management on a broad scale.\n",
      "We invest in the collection and use of high-quality data on the causes and global burden of pneumonia, which will contribute directly to vaccine development, better treatments, improved service delivery, innovation in diagnostics and treatment, and better reporting on causes of death. \n",
      "We also work to raise the profile of pneumonia as a critical child health issue. Our priorities include ensuring sufficient funding for critical vaccines; supporting vaccine and child health advocates; and building political will at the global and country levels for evidence-based pneumonia prevention and treatment. We also seek to increase resources dedicated to immunization programs and to ensure government follow-through on important global health initiatives such as the Global Vaccine Action Plan for the Decade of Vaccines. \n",
      "RSV is one of the most common causes of childhood lung infections, mainly in the first six months of life. Unlike other causes of pneumonia addressed by our strategy, there is no existing vaccine for RSV. We support the development of maternal RSV vaccines. We also work to improve global data collection on mortality and morbidity related to RSV and on the long-term consequences of severe RSV infections. This information will help in evaluating the potential impact and cost effectiveness of RSV vaccines that are under development.\n",
      "We aim to address gaps in data on influenza in developing regions, assess existing strategies to stimulate demand for seasonal influenza vaccines, and ensure that pregnant women and young children in resource-limited settings can access affordable, effective vaccines. \n",
      "Existing influenza vaccines are the basis of our maternal immunization strategy, which may pave the way for additional vaccines for pregnant women. We work with global partners to identify and address scientific, technical, regulatory, operational, and financial challenges to broadening maternal immunization efforts, which serve to protect pregnant mothers and their babies. We also support research to further understand the benefits of maternal influenza immunization on the developing fetus and work to develop improved influenza vaccines for children under age 2. \n",
      "Along with our efforts to broaden immunization against pneumonia and improve treatment, we work to reduce environmental risk factors. Adequate nutrition and breastfeeding—addressed as part of the foundation’s nutrition strategy—are key factors in ensuring that children’s immune systems are equipped to fight off infection. \n",
      "Reducing indoor air pollution is also likely to lessen the risk of pneumonia by decreasing chronic inflammation in the lungs. We invest in limited research to fill fundamental gaps in knowledge about the dose-response relationship between indoor air pollution and childhood pneumonia. We also support efforts to improve monitoring technology to measure personal particulate matter exposure and to establish surrogate endpoints for subsequent clinical trials. Our work in this area will evolve as our understanding of the link between indoor air pollution and pneumonia grows. \n",

      "\t\t\tCell phones connect an increasing number of Kenyans with digitally-based financial tools and services.\n",
      "\t\t\n",
      "More than 2.5 billion adults do not have a bank account or use other formal financial services—not only because of the challenges of living in poverty, but also due to costs, travel distance, and other barriers.\n",
      "Access to formal financial services can help people protect their earnings, weather personal financial crises, send and receive payments, and better manage their farms and small businesses.\n",
      "Our strategy aims to capitalize on rapid advances in mobile communications and digital payment systems to expand the availability of affordable and reliable financial tools that serve the needs of the poorest people.\n",
      "Our Financial Services for the Poor strategy is led by Rodger Voorhies, director, and is part of the foundation’s Global Development Division.\n",
      "Every year, millions of people around the world transition out of poverty in any number of ways—by adopting new farming technologies, investing in new business opportunities, or finding new jobs, for example. At the same time, large numbers of people fall back into poverty due to health problems, financial setbacks, and other shocks. Compounding this situation is the fact that the majority of those living in or near poverty lack even the most basic banking services. Effective tools for saving, sending, and borrowing money and mitigating financial risks can help people weather setbacks and achieve greater financial stability over the long term.\n",
      "Worldwide, more than 2.5 billion adults do not have an account at a financial institution, according to the World Bank’s Global Financial Inclusion Database. Only 41 percent of adults in developing economies have an account—and that number drops to just over 20 percent among adults living in extreme poverty. Women, in particular, are largely excluded from the formal financial system. In developing countries, only 37 percent of women have accounts, compared to 46 percent of men.\n",
      "Most poor households operate almost entirely in the cash economy, particularly in the developing world. This means they use cash, physical assets (such as jewelry and livestock), or informal providers (such as money lenders and payment couriers) to meet their financial needs—from receiving wages to saving money. However, these informal mechanisms can be insecure, expensive, and complicated to use. And they offer limited recourse when a major problem arises, such as a serious illness in the family or a poor harvest. \n",
      "A growing body of evidence suggests that access to the right financial tools at critical moments can determine whether a poor household is able to capture an opportunity to move out of poverty or absorb a shock without being pushed deeper into debt. However, the existing “bricks and mortar” banking system doesn’t work for poor people, in part because most of their transactions are conducted in cash. Handling cash transactions is costly for banks, utilities companies, and other institutions, which pass along the costs associated with storing, transporting, and processing cash to their customers. \n",
      "In wealthier countries, people conduct most of their financial activities in digital form, storing value virtually and transferring it instantaneously. The global revolution in mobile communications, along with rapid advances in digital payment systems, is creating opportunities to connect poor households to affordable and reliable financial tools through mobile phones, kiosks, and other digital interfaces.\n",
      "A migrant worker (left) uses a service point in a neighborhood shop to access his savings account and send money home.\n",
      "In fact, research has shown that the most effective way to significantly expand poor people’s access to formal financial services is through digital means. In addition to cost savings, digital financial services offer a wide array of benefits: \n",
      "The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation’s Financial Services for the Poor program aims to play a catalytic role in broadening the reach of robust, open, and low-cost digital payment systems, particularly in poor and rural areas—and expanding the range of services available on these platforms. Until the infrastructure and customer base are well established, this might involve a combination of mobile banking services that are accessible on digital devices and brick-and-mortar facilities where subscribers can convert the cash they earn into digital money (and vice-versa).\n",
      "We are not focused on a particular product or distribution channel, but rather on finding innovative ways to expand access and encourage markets to determine which products and channels are most effective. At the same time, we are aware that interventions in this and other areas too often involve technologies that are made available to the intended users but are then not adopted. To address this demand-side challenge, we are supporting research and product design experiments to identify design features, price incentives, and marketing messages that will encourage poor people to adopt and actively use digital financial services. We are also supporting policymakers as they work to develop policies and regulations that facilitate these developments and provide oversight and accountability. \n",
      "We believe that the combined effect of these interventions will accelerate the rate at which people can transition out of poverty and build their financial security. Our strategy also recognizes that countries are at different stages in developing an inclusive digital financial system and that any solutions must be appropriate for the cultural and economic context. \n",
      "In countries with a minimum level of connectivity in poor and rural areas, specifically in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Nigeria, we work with in-country providers to extend the reach of digital payment systems into those communities and encourage people to adopt these systems through a mobile phone, kiosk, or other digital interface. Payment systems are crucial because they enable people to collect payments from customers; buy goods; pay utility bills; pay for housing, healthcare, and education; and send money to friends, family, and business partners. They also enable governments to collect taxes, pay public workers, and disburse social payments. When these transactions are costly and inconvenient, economic activity is impeded.\n",
      "In countries where digital payment systems have taken hold in poor and rural communities, specifically in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda, we work with banks, insurance companies, and other providers to increase the range of financial services that people can access in digital form. Many of these services are designed to meet the specific household management needs of low-income people, particularly smallholder farmers and women.\n",
      "We work at the global level with governments, donors, financial standards-setting bodies, and the private sector to maximize our collective impact on poor people’s access to financial services.\n",
      "We collect data to measure the impact of our grants and interventions and to help key stakeholders make better decisions. We also conduct research and nurture innovations that could lead to longer-term improvements in delivering digital financial services on a broad scale.\n",

      "Each year, enteric (gastrointestinal) and diarrheal infections kill about 500,000 children under 5, primarily in the developing world.\n",
      "Gut pathogens are also associated with growth faltering and impaired cognitive development as well as other long-term health problems.\n",
      "We focus on vaccines as a cost-effective way to protect children from infection by specific microbes. We also support the delivery of oral rehydration solution and zinc, which can treat and prevent deaths from diarrheal diseases.\n",
      "We support the goals of the integrated Global Action Plan for Pneumonia and Diarrhoea (GAPPD), an effort led by WHO and UNICEF to accelerate disease prevention and control.\n",
      "Our Enteric and Diarrheal Diseases strategy is led by Director Anita Zaidi and is part of the foundation’s Global Health Division.\n",
      "A major cause of death for children in the developing world, enteric and diarrheal diseases kill about 500,000 children under 5 each year. Children who survive face repeated infections by gut pathogens in the early years of their life, which can lead to serious, lifelong health problems.\n",
      "Evidence suggests an association between repeated gut infections and gut dysfunction, which may lead to poor nutrient absorption, weaker immune response to oral vaccines, stunted growth, and impaired cognitive development. Globally, 159 million children are stunted, which means they face diminished opportunities and productivity over the course of their lifetime.\n",
      "Typhoid fever and its cousin, paratyphoid A fever, are the main causes of bacterial blood infections in children in Southeast Asia; children in many parts of Sub-Saharan Africa also suffer from typhoid. Typhoid stands out as a neglected disease: Children living in densely populated, poor, urban areas with inadequate water and sanitation infrastructure suffer the highest rates of typhoid and paratyphoid fever. Typhoid fever is becoming an even more dangerous public health problem due to rapid and unregulated urbanization in developing countries, combined with the emergence of multidrug-resistant typhoid.\n",
      "The impact of these diseases has gone largely unnoticed. There remains a lack of adequate research, funding, and political commitment to address these diseases. As a result, we lack critical information about the pathogens (including viruses, bacteria, and parasites) that cause these diseases and about the environmental factors that increase their occurrence.\n",
      "There are effective and affordable tools for prevention and treatment available, but most do not reach the poorest.\n",
      "Over the past 20 years, there has been a significant decline in the number of children under 5 who have died from diarrhea, in part due to socioeconomic development and better access to treatment. However, too many children still die from infections that are entirely preventable or treatable. Prevention efforts that focus on vaccines in the short term and improvements in water, sanitation, and hygiene in the long term can significantly reduce both suffering and death from these diseases.\n",
      "Safe and effective vaccines exist for rotavirus and cholera. WHO has recommended that all national immunization plans include rotavirus vaccine, and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, has supported the introduction of the vaccine for low-income countries since 2009. In 2016, ROTAVAC®, a new rotavirus vaccine manufactured by Bharat Biotech, was introduced in India, where the burden of rotavirus is highest. Other new vaccines in development should increase supplies and improve access over the next several years.\n",
      "The cholera vaccine Shanchol, manufactured by Shantha, was licensed in India and approved by WHO in 2011. WHO approved Eubiologics’ oral cholera vaccine, Euvichol, in 2015. Also under development are several vaccine candidates for important diarrheal microbes, enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) and Shigella, and typhoid conjugate vaccines to prevent against typhoid fever.\n",
      "Affordable treatments such as oral rehydration solution, zinc supplements, and antibiotics for children with dysentery are available for children suffering from diarrhea. In addition, exclusive breastfeeding in the first six months of life, improved personal and household hygiene, and access to safe water and better sanitation can help children from getting the infection in the first place.\n",
      "Gut health is a rapidly growing area of research, which is helping us better understand how to support healthy physical and neurocognitive development. Research on the gut microbiome, immune system, and gut barrier present promising opportunities to test and develop new interventions to prevent and reverse stunting.\n",
      "Our primary focus is to advance the development of safe, affordable, and effective vaccines for the leading causes of diarrheal and enteric diseases in low- and lower-middle-income countries. We also invest in research to improve case management and delivery of appropriate treatment to children with diarrhea in high-burden countries. And we are exploring new ways to prevent and reverse growth stunting. To inform decisions on when and how to deploy new interventions and expand the use of existing ones, we fund research on the global and regional burden of these diseases.\n",
      "Dr. Sushmita Karunashri at work in the Laboratory for Rotavirus Studies at the Christian Medical College (CMC) in Vellore, India, 2013.\n",
      "Our portfolio focuses heavily on vaccines because we want to prevent children from suffering from enteric and diarrheal diseases. Our efforts include investments in vaccines for rotavirus and the leading bacterial causes of enteric and diarrheal disease: Shigella, ETEC, cholera, and typhoid.\n",
      "Rotavirus. Rotavirus is the most common cause of diarrheal hospitalizations and deaths in children under 5 in the developing world. Existing rotavirus vaccines have been shown to dramatically reduce the number of hospitalizations and deaths. WHO recommends their use in all countries, particularly in places where diarrhea is a major cause of death among children.\n",
      "We work closely with Gavi and national governments to support the introduction and sustainable delivery of rotavirus vaccines where they are most needed and to ensure adequate supply and appropriate formulations, packaging, and labeling.\n",
      "We also work with PATH and vaccine manufacturers in emerging economies such as China, India, and Indonesia to invest in new rotavirus vaccines that will diversify the market, increase vaccine supply, and decrease costs.\n",
      "Cholera. Cholera kills as many as 130,000 people each year and occurs in both epidemic and endemic settings. At least 51 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia have endemic cholera. Several recent outbreaks in Guinea, Haiti, Sierra Leone, Zimbabwe, and elsewhere have severely strained these countries’ under-resourced health systems.\n",
      "A hand-washing station and chlorine dispenser that are part of a cholera-prevention study in Bangladesh.\n",
      "With our support and the support of other international partners, WHO established a global oral cholera vaccine stockpile in 2013—a key milestone for cholera prevention and control. By the end of 2015, more than 3.3 million doses had been shipped to 10 countries, and the number of requests have increased every year. In addition, the Gavi board approved a US$115 million investment for oral cholera vaccine use in epidemic and endemic settings from 2014 to 2018.\n",
      "Stable vaccine demand should expand supply, lead to more competitive pricing, and spur additional demand in countries with a high burden of cholera. We also support the development of evidence-based policy guidelines for oral cholera vaccine use in outbreak settings, as well as better data collection to build a case for the use of cholera vaccines in endemic areas.\n",
      "Shigella and ETEC. Shigella and ETEC are ubiquitous bacterial pathogens in most regions of the developing world, where they are major causes of moderate to severe diarrhea in children under 5.\n",
      "Our key partner in the development of new ETEC and Shigella vaccines, the PATH Enteric Vaccine Initiative (EVI), is working on a portfolio of vaccine candidates, with the ultimate goal of advancing a portfolio of vaccine candidates against both pathogens.\n",
      "Typhoid. Typhoid kills about 160,000 people each year, with the highest known burden in South Asia. An effective and affordable vaccine is the best short-term solution for controlling typhoid fever in countries with poor access to clean water, sanitation, and hygiene, as well as high rates of antibiotic resistance.\n",
      "We are working with the International Vaccine Institute and vaccine manufacturers to develop a conjugate vaccine that can be used in children under 2 and that will have a longer duration of protection than the current polysaccharide vaccine. In 2015, Bharat Biotech licensed Typbar TCV®, a new typhoid conjugate vaccine for India. This vaccine is currently under review for WHO prequalification. We are also exploring bivalent vaccines that target both typhoid and paratyphoid. Important additional areas of work include improving surveillance systems to accurately measure the disease burden, and developing an intervention toolkit that incorporates both vaccine and water and sanitation interventions against typhoid.\n",
      "Oral rehydration solution and zinc are effective treatments for acute diarrhea, but use of these essential interventions remains low. In addition, acute diarrhea deaths sometimes occur despite the use of oral rehydration, particularly among younger or malnourished children. The landmark Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) in seven Sub-Saharan African and South Asian countries showed that, for children with moderate to severe diarrhea, the risk of death increased by eight-and-a-half times in the two months following the diarrheal episode.\n",
      "Our treatment strategy focuses on ensuring the availability of existing treatments in the highest-burden countries. We invest in research to improve diarrheal treatment and case management. We are also investing in better understanding and addressing under-nutrition as a risk factor for death among children hospitalized with diarrhea. We collaborate with partners to use these research findings to advocate for policy changes and increased funding to expand the availability of key treatment commodities and delivery systems related to child health.\n",
      "We are focused on understanding the relationship between gut dysfunction and stunting in order to develop new diagnostics, therapies, and nutritional solutions. To this end, we invest in the Malnutrition and Enteric Diseases (MAL-ED) Consortium, a multinational, multidisciplinary study that aims to clarify the complex relationships between nutrition, gut infection, gut physiology, immune function, and growth in the first years of life.\n",
      "Through another investment, we are addressing a major obstacle in the field by developing a less invasive way of imaging and sampling the small intestine using a capsule with a microscopic camera and biopsy technology.\n",
      "We also are taking an initial step into therapeutic trials that address stunting by treating underlying gut dysfunction. One strategy aims to use therapeutic foods directed at the gut microbes. Locally sourced foods are being evaluated to see which combinations most effectively grow the good gut bacteria and inhibit the bad bacteria. Our hope is that this will promote healthy growth and development.\n",
      "All of these efforts are part of the foundation’s broader Healthy Birth, Growth, and Development Initiative, which takes a holistic approach to understanding physical and neurocognitive development, from conception to adolescence.\n",
      "Epidemiology and Burden. We work to generate evidence that can help enhance our understanding of burden, evaluate the impact of interventions, and plan future investment strategies. These efforts include studies to define the burden of diarrheal and enteric disease pathogens and assess the effects of vaccine introductions.\n",
      "We are supporting several surveillance networks, including typhoid surveillance in South Asia and Africa, and a larger network of foundation-funded sites through the Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) network.\n",
      "Cryptosporidium. We also support research on Cryptosporidium, which was found to be a significant cause of moderate to severe diarrhea in the GEMS study in South Asia and Africa. Our approach is twofold: First, we are investing in research to better understand the epidemiology and health consequences of the Cryptosporidium parasite. Second, we are pursuing drug development by supporting preclinical tools and models and screening existing compound libraries for potential drugs against Cryptosporidium.\n",
      "We work to ensure that child health is a priority nationally and globally, with sufficient funding and political will to increase the delivery of vaccines, preventive interventions, and treatments for enteric and diarrheal diseases. Our efforts include supporting the goals of the integrated Global Action Plan for Pneumonia and Diarrhoea (GAPPD).\n",

      "Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) affect one billion people worldwide, and the poorest and most vulnerable communities suffer the most. While effective treatment and control methods are available, we need more investments in drug delivery and diagnostic tools that will improve disease-mapping and surveillance.\n",
      "We work with our partners to develop and deliver new tools to address tropical diseases affecting neglected populations. We focus on diseases that present the greatest opportunity for elimination or eradication, and we make use of donated drugs. We also accelerate progress by supporting public-health surveillance, vector control, and the mass drug administration of drugs against multiple diseases.\n",
      "More than 1 billion people in developing countries suffer from infectious diseases that attract little donor funding, largely because those diseases are rare in wealthier countries.\n",
      "These neglected tropical diseases, or NTDs, cause anemia and blindness, stunt children’s growth, lead to cognitive impairments, complicate pregnancies, and result in thousands of deaths each year. People living in extreme poverty often suffer from more than one of these diseases at the same time, which affects their ability to make a living and move out of poverty.\n",
      "Because this public health burden affects dozens of poor countries, we must address NTDs in order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.\n",
      "Today, we have safe, effective treatments and control methods to fight some NTDs. The challenge is reaching poor and hard-to-reach communities in developing countries where people have little access to healthcare.\n",
      "Despite this, recent efforts to combat some of these diseases have been successful, giving us hope that strategic, innovative, collaborative, and sustained action can control, eliminate, or even eradicate some of the NTDs.\n",
      "In 2015, cases of dracunculiasis (guinea worm disease) fell to a historic low of 22, contained in just four countries. While 120 million people are infected with mosquito-borne lymphatic filariasis (elephantiasis), more than 5 billion treatments have been delivered since 2000.\n",
      "The progress against lymphatic filariasis came as a result of a global alliance that delivered drugs donated by Merck, Eisai, and GlaxoSmithKline. Despite limited economic incentives, those pharmaceutical companies have increased their donations and supported research and development on NTDs.\n",
      "Growing resolve within the public and private sectors can accelerate progress even further. In January 2012, the foundation; 13 pharmaceutical companies; the governments of the United States, United Kingdom, and United Arab Emirates; the World Bank; and other global health organizations signed the London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases, launching a global push to control, eliminate, or eradicate 10 NTDs by the end of the decade. This has since shaped the framework for our strategy to fight NTDs.\n",
      "Battling NTDs is a priority for our foundation, and we make sure our investments complement the work of donor governments and developing countries, which provide most of the funding to combat these diseases.\n",
      "We concentrate on areas where existing funds are scarce, where our support can have a catalytic effect, and where we are better positioned than others to assume risks. To date, our team has committed more than US$1.02 billion in grants to organizations developing new tools and methods of delivery that make these tools widely available. We also advocate for increased international funding to support these efforts.\n",
      "Many tropical diseases could be considered neglected, so we target our investments toward diseases that are large in scale and severity, that impose significant social and economic burdens on developing countries, and that have the greatest likelihood of elimination or eradication through strategic, feasible interventions.\n",
      "We currently target the 10 NTDs specified in the London Declaration, and we vary our approach based on the unique challenges of each disease.\n",
      "While we are targeting 10 NTDs, most of our funding goes toward the seven that present the greatest opportunity for elimination or eradication. We support the development and delivery of new drugs, vaccines, diagnostics, vector-control tools, and program approaches, and we tailor our investments to each disease.\n",
      "Our investments focus on the development of new treatments, tools, and control measures, and on ways to make them widely available.\n",
      "One high-opportunity target is onchocerciasis (river blindness), which is caused by a parasitic worm transmitted to humans by black fly bites. Approximately 37 million people are infected, primarily in Africa, but mass distribution of the donated drug ivermectin has helped eliminate the disease in many parts of Africa and South America.\n",
      "However, because this drug kills only worm larvae, adult worms can reproduce and spread the disease. As a result, people infected with the disease must repeat treatment up to twice a year for a decade or more. Another challenge is that millions of people in West Africa are infected by eye worm (also known as loa loa), which makes them unable to tolerate ivermectin. For these people, there is no effective treatment for river blindness.\n",
      "Where possible, we are working to help eliminate river blindness with current drugs. We also support efforts to develop new treatments, including new methods of controlling disease transmission and a new drug that would attack adult worms and could be used for patients with eye worm.\n",
      "We are also targeting lymphatic filariasis, a mosquito-transmitted disease caused by parasitic worms. An estimated 120 million people are infected, and one in six people globally is at risk of this disabling disease.\n",
      "Thanks to efforts to reach remote communities, more than 600 million people have received lymphatic filariasis treatment. To reach the rest, we need to understand where affected people live, so we invest in surveillance and precision-mapping. Until recently, the number of people at risk of lymphatic filariasis in Ethiopia had been estimated at 30 million; mapping showed that the estimate should be reduced to 6 million—saving hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of drugs.\n",
      "Meanwhile, researchers are conducting clinical trials on the administration of lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis drugs in different combinations, dosages, and frequency to achieve better results.\n",
      "The other high-opportunity diseases we target are visceral leishmaniasis (black fever), soil-transmitted helminthiases (hookworm, roundworm, and whipworm), schistosomiasis, dracunculiasis (guinea worm), and human African trypanosomiasis (known as HAT or sleeping sickness).\n",
      "We support efforts to develop new ways to attack multiple infectious diseases at the same time in a coordinated and integrated fashion. We focus on three main areas:\n",

      "Even as the region does continue to face real economic and social challenges – for example, its mushrooming megacities, which are seeing the world’s highest rates of rural-to-urban migration, are not yet designed to withstand the increasing frequency and intensity of climate change events that impact this region – more people are enjoying lives of health and prosperity than ever before.\n",
      "The share of population living in extreme poverty has fallen dramatically in recent decades: in 1990, more than 60 percent of people in the region were living on less than $2 a day, and now it’s only about 3 percent. Over the same time period, mortality rates for women and children in the region have each fallen by more than 60 percent as well.\n",
      "During my first visit to Southeast Asia last month as president of The Rockefeller Foundation, I was struck by the optimism and innovation in this region, driven by a new generation of young leaders who are building a movement in meaningful social impact from the top down as well as bottom up. As we look for ways to confront and address the overwhelming wave of challenges facing the Asia-Pacific, we must channel this dynamism into fresh solutions and innovative partnerships. Critically, we must commit to these innovations and collaborations for impact that is widespread and enduring.\n",
      "The Rockefeller Foundation has always seen this potential in the Asia-Pacific, and in fact has partnered with local entities for more than 100 years. Going back to its earliest days, the Foundation made two historic investments in the region: funding the creation of China’s Peking Union Medical College in Beijing, and helping establish the Siriraj Hospital and associated medical college at Mahidol University in Bangkok, Thailand. These medical institutions are some of The Rockefeller Foundation’s oldest partners in the world, training countless doctors over the decades.\n",
      "In Thailand alone, our partnership with Siriraj Hospital enabled the introduction of  modern science-based medicine and public health that helped combat hookworm throughout Southeast Asia and supported the education of thousands of postdoctoral fellows that have gone on to lead in health and medicine across the region, and even the world – a legacy that is still upheld through our support for the Prince Mahidol Award Conference, where many doctors will gather in Bangkok in the coming weeks.\n",
      "During my visit to Bangkok in December, I was fortunate to spend time with the doctors and nurses of Siriraj Hospital and Medical Center. Today, Siriraj is a leader in community health, serving more than 3,000 outpatients a day. It continues to be at the forefront of science and medicine in Thailand and the region. What excites me even more is the continuing hunger to innovate and make an impact together.\n",
      "Bangkok typifies the challenges many Southeast Asian cities face in combating the stresses of rapid urbanization and the shocks of climate events. It is also a shining example of what collaboration and commitment can achieve at the community level, despite crumbling trust in institutions worldwide. For example, in the wake of Thailand’s 2011 heavy floods – which damaged nearly 100,000 homes, left thousands of households completely destroyed, and took the lives of approximately 650 people – The Rockefeller Foundation’s 100 Resilient Cities has been working with the Bangkok Metropolitan Authority to prevent such a catastrophe from happening again.\n",
      "While in Bangkok I had the chance to tour the Bangkok Water Management Center and Flood Control Center, where data and analytics are being used to understand where people are most vulnerable, so that our teams can focus on those communities, and develop strategies to help them move out of poverty and protect themselves from climate-related threats in the future. I was grateful to meet and visit with some of those community members – just a few of the 50,000 people that have been able to move from their previous, dilapidated homes, which were at great risk of flooding, into stable, flood-protected and affordable homes along Lat Phrao Canal. This means that parents can now raise their families in healthier, safer environments and provide their children with better opportunities for the future. And, with expanded collaboration, driven by science and technology, we can make wider and deeper impacts on the communities that we seek to serve.\n",
      "My visit to Southeast Asia drove home the Foundation’s long-standing conviction that we, as a single institution, cannot solve the world’s most challenging issues by ourselves and we certainly cannot solve them through short-term, one-off partnerships. Making a sustainable impact requires an enduring and lasting commitment. We must commit to collaboration. And we must engage the next generation of philanthropists and social entrepreneurs like Mohamed Abbas who are seeking to make an impact on the world, empower them with capital and resources, learn from them and then grow with them.\n",
      "I look to the future of the Asia-Pacific aware of the challenges that lie ahead, but hopeful about the opportunities to improve the lives of the region’s most vulnerable people. My visit to the region served as an important reminder that we can achieve more, help more people and face the world’s gravest challenges when we’re truly committed to one other and a shared vision for the future.\n"

      "More than 60% of Africa’s population is under 25 years of age, making sub-Saharan Africa the world’s youngest region. By 2030, it will be home to more than one-quarter of the world’s under-25 population.\n",
      "As this young population – the best-educated and globally connected the continent has ever had – enters the world of work, Africa has a demographic opportunity. However, the region can only leverage this opportunity by unlocking latent talent and preparing its people for the future of work.\n",
      "Recognizing the challenge of youth unemployment, and particularly in Africa, the Rockefeller Foundation launched its Digital Jobs Africa (DJA) initiative in 2013. DJA’s goal was to influence systemic change, bringing together the demand and supply sides of the labor market to significantly increase employment opportunities for high potential but disadvantaged youth (HPDY).\n",
      "On the demand side, DJA promoted the adoption of Impact Sourcing by employers, by demonstrating how businesses benefits from hiring well trained marginalized youth. On the supply side, we found that Africa is plagued by a skills gap, where skills are mismatched with employer needs.\n",
      "Every year for the next 30 years, at least 15 million increasingly well-educated youth are expected to join the African workforce. Yet, employers across the region identify skills gaps as a major constraint to their ability to compete in the global economy, making them irrelevant in the employment space.\n",
      "“Every year for the next 30 years, at least 15 million increasingly well-educated youth are expected to join the African workforce.”\n",
      "This is in reference to both technical skills, as well as soft skills that prepare youth to effectively transition to the world of work, from the classroom space, such as interpersonal attributes – service skills, communication skills, time adherence, self-confidence, motivation, and negotiation skills. On the harder skills, digital and numeracy skills also fall short.\n",
      "Failure to address these would mean the youth themselves, as well as their countries’ economies, miss out on opportunities that are emerging from new sectors.\n",
      "DDT refers to those skills development initiatives that are customized to respond directly to the specific requirements of a job role, for an employer or a group of employers, and lead to placement in employment or self-employment. Demand-Driven programs develop and prepare youth for specific job roles.\n",
      "DDT is applicable across all sectors because it seeks to develop a strong link between formal training and actual industry requirements. It is a methodology, a systemic approach to linking skills to demand.\n",
      "Under DJA we made substantial investment through grants to organizations working closely with these HPDYs, with an emphasis on those organizations that can place them in business process outsourcing (BPO), online work, and other direct digital employment opportunities. Some of these were Making Cents International, Harambee Youth Employment Accelerator etc.\n",
      "We have worked with these and other partners who have access to large, diverse networks of local employers, as well as corporate networks. They train the youth, and then connect them to jobs in these networks and in growth sectors such as hospitality and ICT.\n",
      "To date, since the start of the initiative, more than 150, 000 youth have been trained, with more than 45,000 successfully placed in jobs.\n",
      "However, this is only some success. DDT still needs to be scaled, for greater and more immediate impact – to improve the lives of the youth that get employed, and raise Africa’s profile as an investment destination for willing investors. Africa’s chances will increase on the global scale once there is confidence in the presence of a competent talent pool, with skills relevant to employer’s needs.\n",
      "In October of this year, the Rockefeller Foundation and Making Cents International launched the Demand-Driven Training (DDT) Toolkit, which brings together lessons learned from the work we have done with grantees and partners under DJA since the beginning, on how to better link youth with jobs, with both them and their employers reaping optimally.\n",
      "The toolkit will help to bridge the gap between youth skills as acquired through formal education systems, and employer needs. It will benefit governments, Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) institutions, Universities, youth training organizations focusing on skills development, all those who design, develop, deliver youth education and training programs, as well as donor and development partners who support them.\n",
      "Making Cents International created the toolkit by collecting information through a literature review, and site visits with five leading South African DDT providers, and five leading global DDT organizations operating in various markets. It also input by development investors such as Accenture, JP Morgan Chase, the MasterCard Foundation, Prudential, and USAID among others. Eight public and private South African technical and vocation education and training organizations also provided important background and context to their own.\n",
      "The toolkit was deliberately made to be user-friendly, with easy access to tools and resources that organizations can quickly integrate into their own programs, such as screening and measurement tools, handbooks, factsheets, sample course outlines and videos. Its modules cover various critical topics such as Understanding Labor Market Information; Partnering with Employers and Others; Screening, Assessing and Profiling; Developing Soft Skills; Mentoring Youth; Implementing Work-Based Learning; and Monitoring and Evaluating DDT Programs. Best practice tips are also included for implementers to consider as they integrate the content into their own programs, along with examples of how others have done it.\n",
      "DDT is a proven model that shows significant results in transitioning disadvantaged youth to sustainable livelihoods. We have learned that training interventions that closely engage employers produce positive labor market outcomes for youth, particularly those in low- and middle-income countries.\n",
      "For this purpose, we are hoping to take the Toolkit to scale so that more youth can achieve the goal of becoming economically stable. Making Cents International is currently scoping for partners who might be interested in adapting the Toolkit content to their own strategies and initiatives, to work together in making the material context specific.\n",

      "From funding the scientists who developed the vaccine for yellow fever to catalyzing the field of impact investing, The Rockefeller Foundation has a long record of innovation that has led to great transformations.\n",
      "This is a principle that inspires us to pioneer strategies, adopt unique approaches, and work to uncover, pilot, and scale breakthrough solutions. We reframe complex social problems to spark new thinking and recombine existing tools, approaches, and ideas to accelerate meaningful social change.\n",
      "As we urgently address the fundamentals of people’s well-being through initiatives focused on health, energy access, jobs, food, and cities, we are also looking toward a future that will grow from the rapidly evolving trends we observe today. To prepare for that future, we will make bold bets on disruptive solutions that will allow us to leapfrog current approaches.\n",
      "The first area will focus on radically accelerating the pace at which private capital can be deployed towards social challenges.\n",
      "The second area will focus on the ubiquitous and rapidly evolving data and technologies that permeate every aspect of society.\n",
      "The third area will focus on the Foundation’s long-standing belief in science to develop new knowledge and insight that can eventually be applied to improve people’s well-being.\n",
      "Global philanthropic funds, even when combined with the development or aid budgets of governments, add up to billions of dollars. Meanwhile, the cost of solving the world’s most critical problems runs into the trillions—including an estimated $2.5 trillion annual funding gap needed to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in developing countries alone. Private capital is urgently needed in order to fill this gap and address pressing global challenges.\n",
      "The Rockefeller Foundation aims to help data & technology become more useful tools for those seeking to address the big challenges of our time. Based on our insight into the root causes of these challenges and our trusted relationships with government, the private sector, and civil society, we are well-positioned to partner with innovative thinkers to develop and scale technologies to achieve breakthrough results.\n",
      "While in the early stages of shaping our work, The Rockefeller Foundation has a portfolio that ensures that science and fact-based decisions have a place in policy making, explores opportunities in specific scientific fields, and supports approaches to help improve the resourcing and productivity of science overall.\n"

      "Today the global food system produces one-and-a-half times enough food to feed our entire population—yet 815 million people don’t know where their next meal will come from. Nearly 2 billion people suffer from some form of malnutrition, and diet quality is now the number-one contributing factor to deaths and disabilities worldwide according to the World Health Organization. At the same time, agriculture and livestock production are key drivers of global warming and environmental degradation, with meat production accounting for nearly 15 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions – more than the entire transportation sector.\n",
      "At The Rockefeller Foundation, the question we are now asking is: how can we sustainably nourish the world with dignity and equity, without breaking the back of our planet?\n",
      "Our work on food is currently implemented through YieldWise Food Loss, launched in 2016, which aims at halving food loss and waste, YieldWise Food Waste, focused on food waste in the U.S., and through the Alliance for Green Revolution (AGRA), launched in 2006, which is focused on doubling yield and incomes for African farmers.\n",
      "As we look around the horizon, we will work to reshape the global protein economy. Focusing on both human health and the environment, we have to fundamentally rethink the way the world provides protein to a growing and ever wealthier global population to ensure nutritious food is more accessible, available and affordable to everyone around the world.\n",
      "Currently, more than 40 percent of fruits and vegetables in developing regions spoil before they can be consumed. Post-harvest loss reduces the income of small-holder farmers by 15 percent. To address this problem, in 2016 The Rockefeller Foundation launched YieldWise – focused on reducing food loss by focusing on fruits, vegetables, and staple crops in Kenya, Nigeria, and Tanzania—countries where up to half of all food grown is lost.\n",
      "In the U.S., nearly 40% of our food supply is wasted every year. At the same time, 41 million Americans—including 13 million children—lack consistent access to adequate food. Wasted food represents wasted resources: one-fifth of our freshwater supply and nearly one-fifth of our cropland is used to produce food that does not get eaten. When that food is thrown away, it takes up 20% of our landfills where it emits tons of methane, a greenhouse gas 86 times more powerful than carbon dioxide.\n",
      "Food security is critical for both human welfare and economic growth in Africa. About 70 percent of sub-Saharan Africans depend on agriculture for their livelihoods—and smallholder farmers account for 90 percent of food production in sub-Saharan Africa. Yet, many farmers barely produce enough food to feed their families, leaving no money for investing in tools and technologies that could increase yields.\n",

      "Skyscrapers and stadiums have been engineered to sway with earthquakes—yet vulnerable people in cities all over the world are increasingly threatened by more destructive storms and a warming planet. But as we see more people and communities banding together to withstand the turbulence of a changing world, we believe it’s possible to help prepare for a future where three-fourths of humanity will live in cities.\n",
      "Since funding Jane Jacobs to write “The Death and Life of Great American Cities” in 1961, The Rockefeller Foundation has long-viewed cities as places of ingenuity and innovation. Just as we fought urban poverty and helped shape the emerging fields of urban design throughout the 20th century, today, we work to make cities around the world more resilient through our 100 Resilient Cities initiative which is now helping cities worldwide build better and build back to improve the lives and well-being of an urban population expected to reach 75 percent of humanity by 2050.\n",

      "Because of the collision of globalization, urbanization, and climate change, not a week goes by that there’s not a disruption to a city somewhere in the world: a cyber attack, a natural disaster, or economic or social upheaval. Meanwhile, cities face acute stresses, such as poverty, endemic crime and violence, or failing infrastructure, that weaken a city over time.\n",

      "A third of the natural disasters that have occurred around the world in the last three decades have been in Asia. Asia’s cities—among the areas in the world most vulnerable to climate change events—are growing rapidly: By 2025, 30 of the world’s megacities, or urban areas with populations exceeding 10 million, will be in Asia. Yet by mid-century, the region could face annual disaster losses exceeding $19 billion.\n",
      "Africa’s economies are growing at an unprecedented pace—and so is its youth population. Job creation is not keeping up with the youth bulge: By 2050, 400 million people under the age of 25 will be in need of sustainable employment if the continent can expect to continue along its growth trajectory. The rise of the information communications technology (ICT) sector in Africa —as well as the adoption of business outsourcing practices that intentionally hire underemployed demographics.\n",
      "Communities and entire nations around the globe are faced with recurring shocks and stresses that are only increasing in frequency and magnitude—from coastal storms to pandemics to civil conflict. While there are many actors helping to respond to immediate crises, these interventions have traditionally focused on relief and rebuilding, or on longer-term development, without planning for unforeseen shocks and stresses. As a result, $1 of every $3 spent in development assistance is wasted.\n",
      "Between 2011 and 2013, the federal government spent $136 billion on disaster relief in the United States—an average of nearly $400 per household per year. During that time, President Obama declared major disasters in 67 communities in the United States across 48 states, plus Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C. With extreme weather showing no signs of slowing, and rising waters increasing flooding risks around the country, it’s time to change the paradigm of disaster response and recovery.\n",
      "Fresh water is both an elemental human need and a central resource for economic and social development, serving everything from household demands to agriculture, industry, and energy production. One third of the world’s rivers and aquifers—supporting 1.6 billion people—are severely water stressed, meaning that more than 75 percent of their available water is being used.\n",

      "At the close of The Summit, three of The Rockefeller Foundation’s Zero Gap grantees—Africa GreenCo, African Risk Capacity, and United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification—were showcased and one project in particular, the Land Degradation Neutrality Fund (LDNF), received an official commitment from the One Planet participants.\n",
      "The LDNF blends capital from institutional investors, impact investors, international finance institutions, foundations, and public donors to provide financial and technical resources to large-scale rehabilitation projects through financial intermediaries in smaller-scale projects that adopt sustainable land management practices. By investing in rehabilitation at scale, the LDNF will seek to reduce the stress on our natural resources while generating multiple environmental, social, and financial benefits—including greater food security, reduced poverty, greater gender equality, improved water availability, and biodiversity.\n",
      "French President Macron recognizes the initiative as “a very concrete measure: It aims for land degradation neutrality by 2030, which is an achievable goal if we can quickly raise $300 million to start the financing process.”\n",
      "The LDNF is representative of how public and private capital can come together to innovate and accelerate real solutions to combat climate change. Over the last three months, they have raised 30 percent of their target.\n",

      "We’ve rung in another new year, and still, more than 1 billion people around the world live without reliable access to electricity. Penetration of energy services varies widely across countries, and today, overall progress falls substantially short of what is needed to attain the Sustainable Development Goal 7 (access to affordable and clean energy) by 2030. According to the UN, energy access accelerated by a mere 0.3 percentage points between 2012 and 2014, and more than 3 billion people worldwide are still cooking without clean fuels and technologies.\n",
      "Recently, the Rockefeller Foundation led a robust panel on achieving SDG7 at the Responsible Business Forum in Singapore. One thing became vividly clear: achieving any progress on widespread electrification will require stepping up on collaboration not only across sectors but even among the various priorities within the global energy access effort.\n",
      "This is because SDG7 is multi-dimensional in nature. It is about generation as well as distribution, supply as well as demand. It is as much about the infrastructure, technology, and financing as it is about engaging consumers, not only to use electricity but to transform those electrons into economically productive outputs and other social benefits. To move the needle, we need to ensure adequate support for each piece of the energy puzzle and ensure they build on each other.\n",
      "Decentralized electrification has the potential to transform the lives of 1 billion people constrained by lack of access to energy.\n",
      "Perhaps nowhere is the need for a systems approach more real than with achieving SDG7, which requires aligning new pools of capital, innovative decentralized distribution models, supportive public policy, and new technology applications. This is especially true if we are to realize the full potential of decentralized electrification solutions that have proven nimbler and more effective to produce and deploy in remote, under-served areas where heftier mainline grid infrastructure may be too costly to expand into. With the right blend of policy and regulatory support, innovation and technical assistance, we have the opportunity to catalyze a market for private sector players to take to scale, much of it through renewable energy.  This has the potential to transform the lives of 1 billion people whose economic and social progress is being constrained by a lack of access to modern energy.\n",
      "The complex challenge of electrifying over a billion people, and driving an economic revolution with it, is reason enough for us to work more effectively in coalitions, across sectors and siloes.  We need alliances that unleash the collective power of businesses, civil society, and governments at every level.  With concerted action from all actors, ending energy poverty is within our reach.\n",

An early pioneer in resilience-building, we have invested more than a half-billion dollars in helping communities of all kinds generate dividends from investing in economic, climate, and social resilience.\n",

Practitioners took insights from the behavioral sciences to change what they were doing on the ground; artists started thinking about how to apply academic methodologies to measure the impact of their work; and academics reflected on how the arts can help expand our understanding of behavior beyond the cognitive elements to also incorporate the emotions that factor into decision-making.\n",

      "Expanding opportunity to ensure more American workers have jobs that help build a hopeful future for themselves and their families\n",
      "For too many people within the United States today, the American Dream is out of reach—and millions of workers are seeing that hard work alone does not translate to a stable, middle-class life that uplifts future generations. We are working with employers, workers, and policy experts to create more equitable economic conditions for all.\n",
      "We are currently advancing this effort through our work on Impact Hiring, which we’ve applied to help young people access stable employment and career-building jobs, and help employers address critical talent challenges. We are also advancing gender inclusivity in the workplace through our 100×25 campaign, which aims to bring more women to the C-suite by 2025. Looking ahead, we will help ensure American workers have the tools and support they need to compete and thrive in a changing world.\n",
      "It is no secret that women have historically faced greater barriers than men when it comes to fully participating in the economy. Across geographies and income levels, disparities between men and women persist in the form of pay gaps, uneven opportunities for advancement, and unbalanced representation in important decision-making. Women in leadership, however, have proven to be beneficial for both the company and individual employees.\n",
      "While overall unemployment levels have decreased over the past several years, economic opportunity has remained stubbornly out of reach for some. The unemployment rate for younger workers remains more than double the national average. For these young people, failure to gain an early foothold in the labor market can translate to a lifetime of lower earnings, family and community instability, and a host of other challenges.\n",

      "Computers on wrists can track steps and heart rates 24/7, yet over 16,000 children die every day from things as basic as pneumonia and diarrhea. Individual and population collective health are jeopardized by an array of challenges, including food insecurity and poor nutrition, infectious and non-communicable diseases, and, in many developing countries, uneven access to quality care at the community level.\n",
      "The Rockefeller Foundation has a long history in health—from eradicating hookworm in the American South, to creating the field of public health, to developing the yellow fever vaccine. We continue to support innovative strategies that incentivize individuals, communities, governments, and funders to address the breadth of variables that contribute to healthy societies.\n",
      "Today, our portfolio of work in health includes support for Planetary Health, Universal Health Coverage, and Disease Surveillance Networks. We are actively exploring new ways of connecting hard to reach communities to digitally-enabled health care.\n",
      "Unparalleled public health, agricultural, industrial, and technical advancements of the 20th century created the conditions for better health for billions of people. Yet this tremendous socio-economic progress is taking a heavy toll on the Earth’s natural systems. Between unsustainable resource consumption and population growth, there is growing evidence that the planet’s capacity to sustain the growing human population is declining.\n",
      "While health spending has increased dramatically around the world, access to affordable, quality services—without the risk of financial hardship—has lagged. At the same time, though health systems increasingly serve as buffers between vulnerable communities and crises, inadequate and ill-resourced national health systems lack the capacity to meet daily health needs, let alone anticipate, prepare for, and recover from health shocks down the line.\n",
      "Over the last two decades, the global health and economic impacts of SARS, H5N1, H1N1, and Ebola have raised global awareness of pandemic threats. In many cases, the most at-risk regions lacked the capacity to effectively monitor and report the first signs of outbreaks within their nations—let alone coordinate such communications with neighboring countries.\n",

      "NEW YORK, November 15, 2017—A group of the world’s leading philanthropists today announced the formation of Co-Impact (www.co-impact.io), a new global model for collaborative philanthropy and social change at scale. Co-Impact will invest US $500 million in three critical areas—health, education, and economic opportunity—to improve the lives of underserved populations across the developing world.\n",
      "Co-Impact’s goal is to improve the lives of millions by advancing education, improving people’s health, and providing economic opportunity so that all families, no matter where they live, have a more hopeful future.\n",
      "Co-Impact is founded on the belief that achieving these goals requires collaboration and partnership, long-term support for promising approaches, and a commitment from key actors to change underlying systems. Systems change succeeds by bringing together local communities, non-profits, governments, business, donors, and others to drive lasting change beyond what any individual actor could possibly do alone. Co-Impact’s role is to connect philanthropists with each other and with social change leaders to develop, support, and invest in proven solutions that are ready to scale even further.\n",
      "Co-Impact’s initial core partners are Richard Chandler, Bill and Melinda Gates, Jeff Skoll, Dr. Romesh and Kathy Wadhwani, and The Rockefeller Foundation. The core partner group will define strategy and select the opportunities Co-Impact will support. In addition to its role as a core partner, The Rockefeller Foundation has incubated Co-Impact and will provide staff, significant operating funds, and ongoing strategic support. The EkStep Foundation, co-founded by Rohini and Nandan Nilekani, will serve as Co-Impact’s technical partner by supporting a number of Co-Impact programs with their open knowledge and societal platform assets as well as capacity building.\n",
      "Co-Impact expects to add additional core partners as well as co-investors interested in specific initiatives or geographic areas. In addition, a Co-Impact Network will provide a broader group of philanthropists from around the world with an opportunity to contribute, exchange, and learn from Co-Impact’s model.\n",
      "Olivia Leland, Managing Director at The Rockefeller Foundation and founding director of the Giving Pledge, is the founder of Co-Impact and will be Co-Impact’s CEO.\n",
      "“We believe that collaboration is critical to solving some of the world’s most daunting social challenges,” said Leland. “Our goal is to build a community where philanthropists can work and learn together – along with successful social change leaders – to drive extraordinary results. Our hope is that over time more philanthropists will come together to pool resources and expertise to support great social change approaches and drive results at scale.”\n",
      "Co-Impact will make its first system change grants in the first half of 2018. These grants will be informed by more than a year’s worth of due diligence and field research. Systems change grants will be up to US $50 million, flexibly structured, and will go to initiatives with proven leadership and results that are poised to scale even further. Co-Impact will also seek to unlock additional participation by governments and the private sector.\n",
      "The model for Co-Impact grew out of Leland’s experience with the Giving Pledge and subsequent research with donors and social change leaders. That research identified key gaps in the current philanthropic and social change landscape.\n",
      "There are few effective mechanisms for donors to pool expertise and resources to fund large multi-year projects or for social change leaders to find the philanthropists interested and capable of providing that long-term capital and support. As a result, donors must invest significant time and resources to find, vet, and manage even one game-changing investment. This limits the number of large-scale projects being funded, and keeps many donors from being able to engage in these kinds of projects, despite their desire to do so. Similarly, social change leaders must devote extraordinary amounts of time and energy to piecing together disparate and ultimately insufficient funding, limiting their ability to scale their work.\n",
      "The result is that with the exception of a handful of extraordinary global initiatives, most giving today is for US $10 million or less, short-term, and focused on growing individual organizations rather than creating change at the systems level.\n",
      "“Servant leadership means putting the people we serve at the center of everything we do, and that will be part of the culture of Co-Impact. The founding partners are committed to supporting the champions of human development – bold leaders who are working to unlock the creative potential of individuals, communities, and nations.”\n",
      "“Co-Impact is an innovative new model for philanthropy that has the potential to make a big difference in the lives of the world’s poorest. We’re pleased to be part of it.”\n",
      "“We live in a pivotal time where many people across the world are struggling to attain the very fundamentals of human well-being. Yet we know it is possible to help even the most vulnerable of families move themselves out of poverty, send their children to school, and protect those children from simple, but too often deadly, diseases. Achieving these goals will require a focus on fundamentally changing the way philanthropy, social change leaders, governments, business, and civil society work together—and that is the kind of collaboration and partnership that Co-Impact will enable.”\n",
      "“Time is not on our side on some of the world’s most pressing issues. Investing more in social entrepreneurs’ proven work allows them to accelerate their pace and reach, and enhances the possibility of achieving transformational social change sooner. It’s a pleasure to join this new philanthropic collaborative along with people I greatly admire, in support of the change-makers our world needs.”\n",
      "“An increasing number of philanthropists are expanding their global commitments, especially in critical areas such as health, education, and job creation. The Co-Impact platform will allow all of us collaboratively to leverage the capabilities that each of us has developed individually to enable system change for large scale social impact and best outcomes. Co-Impact will be a catalyst for collaborative global philanthropy in partnership with the most promising NGOs and governments.”\n",
      "“At EkStep Foundation, we are investing in creating open digital public goods. Our intent is for it to benefit an ecosystem of innovators who can create contextual solutions for the development sector through the Societal Platforms approach. We support Co-Impact’s visionary efforts of driving large-scale systemic development, and are glad to be their Technical Partner in this endeavour.”\n"

      "Innovating new models to both generate and provide access to clean energy that will foster economic development.\n",
      "Cars today can drive 300 miles with no gasoline, yet in rural Asia and Africa children are choking from kerosene lamps, women risk danger walking unlit roads, and families are trapped in poverty all because they don’t have access to electricity. But as we see more families and businesses using solar panels and neighborhood micro-grids, we believe it’s possible to bring electricity to the 1.2 billion people who live without it. Just as we created a market for investments that make impact, not just money, we must create a new market for bringing energy to the developing world – extending a key ladder to opportunity for hundreds of millions living in poverty.\n",
      "Building off the global momentum to bring sustainable energy to all, The Rockefeller Foundation is working with governments, the private sector, technologists, and other advocates to catalyze an energy transformation by accelerating electrification in environmentally and economically sustainable ways. Through our Smart Power for Rural Development initiative, our aim is to spark long-term economic growth and power opportunities for those left behind in the modern economy— empowering and bringing dignity to the lives of millions.\n",
      "More than one billion people across the globe are locked out of the modern economy because they lack sufficient access to electricity to power their homes, communities, and businesses. If we provide access to reliable electricity, we can power social and economic development and transform lives.\n",

      "Masimo is an entrepreneur, innovator, visionary and leader who, together with co-founder Izak Petersen, has built the Mergence group from the bottom up over more than a decade to the success story that it is today.\n",
      "Click to read more >Through a unique, inspiring approach to leadership Masimo is ensuring that Mergence cultivates a generation of thought leaders that drive innovation in the financial industry.\n",
      "In 2004, Masimo and Izak bonded their own properties to finance their vision of a diversified financial services group. By 2017, Mergence Africa Holdings had approximately R30 billion of assets under management, and some 50 employees. There are five subsidiary companies spanning asset management, derivative trading and property investment and financing – including the listed Dipula Income Fund whose CEO is Izak Petersen.\n",
      "Masimo’s home language is Setswana and his name – Masimo-a-Badimo – means the Lands of the Gods (ancestors). As a boy, his first foray into entrepreneurship was collecting empty bottles for cash in Soweto. At the age of 20, Masimo received a tuition waiver (scholarship) to attend Kean University in New Jersey, USA and following his graduation in 1995, he started his career as a financial data analyst on Wall Street working for a subsidiary of the Thompson Financial Group. In 1997 he enrolled for an MBA (Finance) at Rutgers University and thereafter joined Merrill Lynch in London on the convertible bonds desk. Masimo returned to South Africa in 2000 to run an equity derivatives book at Gensec Bank, currently Sanlam Capital Markets.\n",
      "Masimo is driven by a ceaseless quest to “create shared value” so that when he returns to the townships of his youth (Soweto and Alexandra in Gauteng) he can explain to people what it actually is that Mergence does – that is to invest with an impact, so that communities can benefit and see tangible changes, whether this is in job creation, education, housing, township malls or energy. Similarly, he has spent holidays building houses for those who have none. Through his personal philanthropic foundation, he actively seeks to uplift communities and individuals, with a focus on education and sport.\n",
      "Driven by a bet to swim to Robben Island in 2009, Masimo learnt to swim and became the first black man to swim from Robben Island. He now loves the ocean and spends his downtime freediving, spearfishing and surfing.\n",

      "Masimo is an entrepreneur, innovator, visionary and leader who, together with co-founder Izak Petersen, has built the Mergence group from the bottom up over more than a decade to the success story that it is today.\n",
      "Click to read more >Through a unique, inspiring approach to leadership Masimo is ensuring that Mergence cultivates a generation of thought leaders that drive innovation in the financial industry.\n",
      "In 2004, Masimo and Izak bonded their own properties to finance their vision of a diversified financial services group. By 2017, Mergence Africa Holdings had approximately R30 billion of assets under management, and some 50 employees. There are five subsidiary companies spanning asset management, derivative trading and property investment and financing – including the listed Dipula Income Fund whose CEO is Izak Petersen.\n",
      "Masimo’s home language is Setswana and his name – Masimo-a-Badimo – means the Lands of the Gods (ancestors). As a boy, his first foray into entrepreneurship was collecting empty bottles for cash in Soweto. At the age of 20, Masimo received a tuition waiver (scholarship) to attend Kean University in New Jersey, USA and following his graduation in 1995, he started his career as a financial data analyst on Wall Street working for a subsidiary of the Thompson Financial Group. In 1997 he enrolled for an MBA (Finance) at Rutgers University and thereafter joined Merrill Lynch in London on the convertible bonds desk. Masimo returned to South Africa in 2000 to run an equity derivatives book at Gensec Bank, currently Sanlam Capital Markets.\n",
      "Masimo is driven by a ceaseless quest to “create shared value” so that when he returns to the townships of his youth (Soweto and Alexandra in Gauteng) he can explain to people what it actually is that Mergence does – that is to invest with an impact, so that communities can benefit and see tangible changes, whether this is in job creation, education, housing, township malls or energy. Similarly, he has spent holidays building houses for those who have none. Through his personal philanthropic foundation, he actively seeks to uplift communities and individuals, with a focus on education and sport.\n",
      "Driven by a bet to swim to Robben Island in 2009, Masimo learnt to swim and became the first black man to swim from Robben Island. He now loves the ocean and spends his downtime freediving, spearfishing and surfing.\n",

      "LONDON, UK – Vital Capital’s Chief Investment Officer and Founding Partner, Mr Eytan Stibbe, spoke to more than 200 private equity professionals assembled here for a two-day conference on investing in Africa.\n",
      "This year marks the third annual gathering for PEI’s growing Africa Forum. Last year, 2010, saw more than $1.48 billion raised for private equity funds for Africa, with promise for even larger commitments in 2011, as more investors look ever more deeply at this exciting and emerging market.\n",
      "Of particular interest to conference attendees this year is the identified need for more than $120 billion in infrastructure backlog in Africa. With a track record of more than 25 years of successfully undertaking complex infrastructure projects in Sub-Saharan Africa, Mr Stibbe was asked by PEI to address the Conference on his views on such market opportunities. Specifically, conference attendees were interested in what it takes to deliver projects of scale in Africa and how they are exited, how governments are partnering on such projects, and what types of projects are most of interest to private equity investors.\n",
      "Responding to a question from the audience on the subject of Impact Investing as an emerging asset class in infrastructure projects, Mr Stibbe said, “Impact Investing can only be profitable if you invest in people first, not just a market alone. We have experience in agriculture and housing at scale and we have been successful because we are focused on building communities. By building communities you create stability and commerce – you deliver, in fact, an economy. This is the way to develop emerging markets and it starts with an investment in people – then profit always will follow”.\n",

      "The Cameroon Cataract Development Impact Loan, a new way of funding health care in low and middle income countries, will be used to prevent blindness through the provision of as many as 18,000 cataract surgeries in Cameroon over the next five years, by bringing together public and private investors, health donors, and eye care delivery experts. \n",
      "This is a type of Development Impact Bond, a results-based contract in which investors provide financing for social programs upfront, and donor organizations repay investors their principal plus a return based on realized performance in delivering social outcomes. In an environment where the need for international development funding often outstrips the resources available, these instruments offer a promising new solution for more effective, efficient financing. \n",
      "The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) has committed a USD $2 million loan in support of this project. OPIC, the U.S. Government’s development finance institution, is one of the first development finance institutions to commit funding to a project using this kind of innovative financial instrument. The Netri Foundation, a private foundation that fights poverty through social impact investments, will also be providing upfront financing for this project. \n",
      "The funding will support the Magrabi ICO Cameroon Eye Institute (MICEI), which has been established by the Africa Eye Foundation. MICEI will not only provide comprehensive, high-quality and affordable eye care procedures, but will also play an important role in strengthening health care systems by developing healthcare talent for the region by providing certified (through the University of Yaoundé) training to grow the next generation of African eye care experts. \n",
      "This Cameroon transaction is anchored by a diverse coalition of partners. Those who will repay investors upon meeting performance goals include The Conrad N. Hilton Foundation, The Fred Hollows Foundation, and Sightsavers. The Africa Eye Foundation is the implementing partner and service delivery expert. D. Capital Partners is the financial intermediary who helped structure and raise this funding. \n",
      "The primary donor and founder of the hospital, Dr. Akef el-Maghraby, internationally renowned ophthalmologist and Chairman of the Magrabi Hospital Group says, “My goal is to make high quality eye care accessible to the people of Cameroon regardless of their ability to pay. MICEI is the first of AEF’s three projects in sub-Saharan Africa as we aim to construct and operate a network of integrated and self-sustainable eye hospitals, across Africa.” \n",
      "As the main financial contributor to the outcome funding pool, “We are thrilled to be part of an innovative approach to addressing cataract presented in the Cameroon Cataract Performance Bond,” said Peter Laugharn, President and CEO of the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation. “This pioneering financing mechanism will help build greater eye care capacity and contribute to the financial sustainability of MICEI’s operations, providing vital services to those needlessly suffering from avoidable blindness both now and into the future.” \n",
      "“In Sub-Saharan Africa, the rate of blindness and vision impairment is twice the global average, with 80 per cent of cases preventable or treatable. Half of those living with avoidable blindness are affected by cataract, a clouding of the lens which can be easily treated with a simple 20-minute surgery. Investors will have the unique opportunity to positively influence the lives of some of the world’s most vulnerable people,” said Brian Doolan, CEO of The Fred Hollows Foundation. \n",
      "Cataract surgery is one of the most cost-effective interventions available as it delivers high quality treatment with consistently high success rates. \n",
      "“Cataract remains the single biggest cause of avoidable blindness and making eye health services accessible to all, including the world’s poorest people, is essential if we are to prevent millions losing their sight unnecessarily,”says Sightsavers’ CEO, Caroline Harper. “Impact bonds are a new way of financing eye health care in low and middle income countries and we are keen to learn how such schemes can be scaled up and sustained in the long run as they have the potential to unlock resources, not only to provide cataract surgery, but also to strengthen eye health systems through improving health care infrastructure and the training of ophthalmic staff.” \n",
      "An estimated 48,000 surgeries are needed each year in Cameroon to treat new cases of cataracts as well as the current backlog of people who need cataract surgery, estimated to be 115,000. \n",
      "“OPIC understands that investment is essential for addressing major challenges like access to healthcare in the developing world, and we are committed to using innovative financing structures to help ensure resources are used efficiently and results are tracked,” said Ray W. Washburne, OPIC President and Chief Executive Officer. “The use of development impact bonds will bring both efficiency and accountability to this important project to reduce preventable blindness in Cameroon, which disproportionately affects women.” \n",
      "“Netri is excited to support MICEI’s implementation of the ‘Aravind Model’ in Cameroon, first demonstrated as an effective cross-subsidization model in India, where paid eyecare services are used to subsidise free and discounted cataract surgeries for low-income patients. Thousands of people will regain their eyesight who otherwise would not have had the means to receive such treatment” says Josephine Ragni, Social Investment Manager at Netri. \n",
      "There are just three ophthalmologists per one million people in Cameroon, compared with a global average of around 31 ophthalmologists per one million people. \n"

      "Currently 30% of Myanmar is electrified, with over 30 million people having no access to power. The government has set a goal of 100% electrification rate by 2030. To support the achievement of this goal and promote the growth of the mini-grid sector, we worked with The Rockefeller Foundation to develop a strategy for the creation of Myanmar's first Mini-Grid Programme Facility (MPF). The MPF aims to support the electrification of approximately 26,000 villages by 2030.\n",
      "We conducted primary and secondary research to understand the opportunity for solar/hybrid mini-grids in Myanmar in terms of number of potential grids. Drawing on previous mini-grid projects in India and internationally, we created a framework for the MPF which is responsive to key challenges in Myanmar. We also built relationships with domestic and international stakeholders, with a view to them contributing to the facility, and engaged key energy companies to support the facility.\n",

      "Winesi March has never seen his 18-month old grandson – he has only ever heard him cry. Prior to going blind from cataracts, Winesi was the breadwinner: his maize farm fed his family and kept his children in school. But as his cataracts developed, he had to rely on his wife and children for tasks as simple as bathing. He stopped growing his maize. He could no longer see the path to his farm.\n",
      "Winesi’s blindness and its impact on his household is part of a widespread and growing problem across developing countries. Four out of five blind people are needlessly blind, most of them live in developing countries, and the reason for their blindness is more often than not due to cataracts.\n",
      "Cataracts, the partial occlusion of the eye lens, affect both men and women, especially above 50. Untreated cataracts lead to blindness for millions of people in developing countries due to high cost of quality care and low cataract surgery capacity. Funding for eye health services makes up just a sliver of local and international health funding—in Cameroon, it is only a fraction of the 2% GDP spending on health. In Central Africa alone, our estimates show that 75,000 people suffer from cataract blindness and another 3 million are at risk, but there are only 122 active ophthalmologists in the region. Cataract surgery should be a relatively straightforward and cost-effective procedure, but public health systems are underfunded and service providers are constrained by scarce, competitive, and expensive financing.\n",
      "The bottom line is, the financing model for eye health in developing countries is broken. And as a result, those who can least afford to are losing their sight.\n",
      "Innovators have found a way to ease this quintessential development problem. The Aravind Eye Hospital in India has pioneered and revolutionized an innovative and cost-effective approach to tackling cataracts in the developing world—a social enterprise model that delivers high-quality cataract surgeries for $40 each, half the cost of an annual Amazon Prime membership. Aravind hospitals gross over $10 million annually through 300,000 cataract surgeries, half of which are free or subsidized. This model proves that it is possible to provide sustainable, affordable quality cataract surgery at high volumes, with fees from those who can pay subsidizing treatment costs for those who cannot.\n",
      "So what if we could replicate this model in Central Africa? Unfortunately hospitals looking to do so face a financing wall. A sub-specialty eye hospital in Cameroon that could perform 6,000 surgeries per year and build local capacity would cost about $13 million to build, equip, and staff before serving a single patient. The drip-drop of public finance is not going to cut it. Private investors find the prospect too risky. From the hospital’s point of view, a debt investment would compromise financial sustainability and ability to scale while keeping costs low.\n",
      "What we need is an entirely new financing model that brings private funders into the eye care space by sharing the risk across public and private partners. A third-party promise to pay for performance could be the key making this possible.\n",
      "A unique coalition of eye health NGOs (Fred Hollows Foundation, Sightsavers, and Africa Eye Foundation) worked together with Dalberg Capital to build a financing mechanism that will bring on new funders in eye care. The result is the Cameroon Cataract Performance Bond (“Cataract Bond”), which will help scale and replicate successful eye health delivery models in Cameroon and other vulnerable regions of the world.\n",
      "The coalition’s vision is twofold: 1. to help start and sustainable scale the first sub-specialty eye hospital in the CEMAC region for service delivery and capacity building; and 2. to demonstrate value-for-money through a financing model that can be replicated in other developing countries over the long-term. The Cataract Bond will provide the upfront funding needed to launch a hospital in Cameroon from private social impact investors. In return for sharing implementation risk with the hospital, outcome funders, philanthropic funders in the eye health sector, will reimburse investors based on the performance of the hospital. Investors make positive returns for restoring sight to the blind, and outcome funders gain more impact efficiency from their grant dollars. Together, both funding parties help build a sustainable, high-volume eye hospital in a region that would not otherwise have none.\n",
      "The Cataract Bond is a pioneering step to providing sustainable and affordable eye care in sub-Saharan Africa. The Bond will help restore sight to people like Winesi who, upon seeing his grandchild for the first time after his cataract surgery, burst into tears of joy. Since his surgery, Winesi has been able to live an independent and vibrant life as part of his family and his community.\n",

      "A new report released today by the World Bank Group’s Lighting Global Program, Dalberg Advisors and GOGLA finds that the global off-grid solar industry has taken a leap in the past year to help developing countries reach their energy access goals. Dalberg estimates that, to date, the off-grid solar sector has provided improved electricity to as many as 360 million people.\n",
      "The 2018 Off-Grid Solar Market Trends Report, funded by the World Bank’s Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP), is the biennial flagship publication for the global off-grid solar industry. It will be formally launched during the 2018 Global Off-Grid Solar Forum and Expo, which takes place this week in Hong Kong. As an in-depth study of the industry, the report will set the tone for the convening by highlighting key industry investment trends, advances in technology, finance, policy and social impacts during the opening plenary to the 600+ industry stakeholders in attendance.\n",
      "One of the key findings of the report is the dynamic growth of solar devices over the past decade: an estimated 130 million off-grid solar products have been sold globally since 2010, ranging from small portable lanterns to 100+ Watt solar home systems capable of powering appliances such as TVs and fans. Selling in over 100 countries, these devices often provide critical first-time access to lighting and other energy services to the 2.2 billion people who still lack grid connection or reliable electricity. As the market has grown, so has the supplier base: a little over 60 dedicated suppliers in 2010 has grown to over 330 today, with increasing specialization along the value chain.\n",
      "In 2016, the most recent year for which complete data is available, total sales amounted to over 30 million devices, generating an estimated USD 1 billion in revenue. Sales growth of smaller devices are stabilizing, while larger devices have witnessed explosive growth of over 85% annually since 2014. This has been driven largely by pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) sales. PAYGO financing is bringing solar products within reach of more consumers than ever, and has the potential to revolutionize consumer financing in emerging markets across a much wider spectrum of products.\n",
      "“The numbers in the report reflect a dynamic young industry that is altering the economic landscape of developing countries while delivering unprecedented development impact,” explains Russell Sturm, Global Head of Energy Access at the International Finance Corporation.\n",
      "“However, the real story of the sector lies in the transformative power of innovation as revolutionary new business models and disruptive technologies continue to emerge across the market. This report provides a compelling view under the hood of that dynamic machine and casts a light on what may lie around the corner”.\n",
      "Investment in the sector doubled annually from 2012-2016, with companies raising approximately USD 922 million in financing between 2012 and 2017. Ten market leaders have moved ahead of the pack, attracting over 90% of all financing in 2016. Funding has also become more commercial in nature: the majority of financing since 2014 has been through equity deals, with a rapidly rising share of debt. While fundamentals remain strong, profitability has eluded the vast majority of players. Moving forward, an injection of capital will no longer be a substitute for a long-term, sound business model.\n",
      "Governments, too, are increasingly supportive of the off-grid solar market: they are incorporating off-grid solar solutions into their national electrification plans and developing regulation to support the private sector and protect consumers. Fast-moving performance and cost improvements in solar PV, battery, and appliance technologies also amplify the sector’s potential.\n",
      "Together, these and other trends explored in the report are expected to boost annual off-grid solar sales to 70 million units and USD 8 billion in revenues in 2022.\n",
      "“Over the next five years, technology performance and cost improvements could reduce prices by up to 40%, and consumer incomes are rising in most target markets. Hence, we expect off-grid solar devices to be in 150 million un- and under-electrified households in 2022, reaching around 740 million people.\"\n",
      "Gaurav Gupta, Dalberg Regional Director for Asia and head of the firm’s energy practice goes on to explain: “That is a strong reflection of how private markets can help address a social challenge at speed and quality, if given the right support.” \n",
      "“This report paints a picture of an industry that has firmly claimed its place in the energy landscape. It will continue to innovate quickly and is only becoming better at serving energy needs for customers in developing countries”.  \n"

      "Dalberg is thrilled to announce the launch of Convergence: the world’s first deal sourcing platform that helps public and private investors find and connect with each other for blended finance investments in emerging and frontier markets. Conceived under the World Economic Forum and OEC-DAC’s ReDesigning Development Finance Initiative, Convergence was designed and launched by the Global Development Incubator and Dalberg Global Development Advisors and is now an independent organization headquartered in Toronto.\n",
      "Conergence aims to increase deals in emerging and frontier markets by connecting public, philanthropic, and private money and expertise through blended finance: the strategic use of public and philanthropic funds to attract private capital towards investments that can deliver development impact in emerging and frontier markets. When private investors can go in on a deal with public co-investment support, they benefit from lower risks and/or enhanced returns on these investments. This marks a midway point between traditional impact investing and purely commercial investing platforms, in a way that is region and sector-agnostic.\n",
      "So what does this look like in practice? Let’s say an asset manager (private investor) is looking to invest in a chain of low-cost hospitals targeting the poor in West Africa but fears that the macroeconomic climate is too risky. The investor has also never invested in West Africa before, and is unsure about how investments work in the region. This investor creates an account and logs on to Convergence. Through the Investment Network, the investor posts the West Africa hospitals investment opportunity and connects with public investors who have experience in low-cost healthcare, who have networks across West Africa, and who can help mitigate risks. The investor then uses the platform’s historic deals database to review comparable transactions that have happened in the past. A topic primer section helps the investor learn about the mandates, processes, and priorities of various potential public investor partners.\n",
      "By connecting public, philanthropic, and private funds, Convergence is expected to unlock billions of private sector dollars for global development, which can lead to a ten-fold increase in overall investment in emerging and frontier markets. As we face a $2.5 trillion funding gap for the SDGs, the need for blended finance is more paramount than ever before.\n"

      "Whether working alongside our clients, starting our own ventures or collaborating, we are always laser-focused on creating positive impact. We're not consultants, investors, designers or researchers who are conscientious about the externalities of our work. We consult, invest, design and research purely in service of our impact objective. \n",
      "Sympathy brings with it condescension. Empathy is built on humility and a willingness to step out of your own shoes and walk in someone else's. We know that marginalized people understand their needs far better than any outsider ever will. So, we listen. And we learn.\n",
      "We're not afraid to give voice to what we know is right, or best or true. We don't use consultant-speak to cover over uncertainty. We thoughtfully pull back the layers of complexity and ambiguity to reveal the pure truth underneath - whether it is with respect to strategy or impact.\n",
      "Solutions to complex problems don't come easily or safely. We need to push beyond our comfort zone - and sometimes that of our clients. We are willing to stake our reputation on ideas, people and approaches that challenge the status quo. We take risks knowing that the full force of Dalberg is behind us, ready to catch us if we fail.\n",
      "We are equally at home in a boardroom in Bamako, a workshop in Washington and a farm outside Firozabad.

      "We don't shy away from problems, we dig deeper. Inherent in every problem is the promise of a solution, and in every solution, the opportunity to create value. We don't see problem-solving as an intellectual exercise. We see it as a moral imperative - to create a world where the concepts of \"have and have nots\" is a truly foreign and bygone notion.\n",

These pages are updated as new positions open, so we encourage you to check frequently.\n",
      "If the listed positions do not match your background or location preference, you can apply through the General Application link on our “Current Openings” page. Applying through this process adds your CV and details to the our databases, but not into an active recruiting process. You should continue to monitor our website and update your application if you see an active position that is of interest and fits your background and location preferences.\n",
      "For most positions, recruiting takes place on an annual basis. Open positions will always be listed on the “Current Openings” page of our website, which is updated as new positions open. Recruiting for undergraduate level analysts begins in August, with a start date for the following year. Recruiting for first-year graduate level (e.g., MBA, MPA) consultants begins in December. Please check our website around these times for additional information on the application process and deadlines.\n",
      "Dalberg Advisors recruit a wide range of graduate and undergraduate level interns. Globally, recruitment for graduate interns begins each December and information will be posted on our website at that time. Recruitment for undergraduate interns varies by region, please check our job openings section for relevant postings.\n",
      "While there is not one profile or characteristic that defines an ideal candidate, there are a number of characteristics that we typically see in successful candidates:\n",
      "As part of our interview process, you will be asked to work through a case study with your interviewer. This will give you an example of the challenges we address each day and give us a chance to see you use your problem solving skills and knowledge to tackle these issues. These cases will be similar to the case interview format used by many management consulting firms, but will focus on international development-related challenges to reflect the type of work that we do. Your interviewer may also ask you about your past academic and professional experiences, team and leadership activities, and your specific interests in development and our work.\n",
      "The best way to prepare for our interviews is to practice case studies. You can find practice cases and tips for approaching case interviews on the internet. We recommend reviewing these materials and practicing actual case studies with friends and family. We also recommend reading our website and blog to become familiar with our practice areas and past projects. This will support your preparation for the case studies, which are based on the type of work that we do, and for additional interview questions, which may focus on how your studies and experience relate to our work.\n",
      "To learn more about Dalberg, we encourage you to join one of our regular informational sessions. These webinars provide an overview of our work, what it is like to work at Dalberg, our recruiting process, and an opportunity to ask questions directly to our staff. Webinars are held periodically throughout the year.\n",
      "Dalberg offers a highly entrepreneurial environment with no single fixed career path. This is demonstrated in the numerous paths taken by our current consultants and alumni. For example, we have staff who have stayed at Dalberg from early in their career through to the partner level, staff who have left for graduate school and returned to Dalberg after graduation, and alumni who left Dalberg to pursue other opportunities in the sector. Career progression at Dalberg is based on performance. Therefore, there are no set lengths of time that consultants are required to stay in a position before being considered for promotion. Promotion decisions are made based on our ongoing feedback and professional development processes. In addition to informal feedback provided throughout projects, consultants receive formal feedback at the end of each client engagement and every six months during their professional development review.\n",
      "We are committed to providing our staff with training and professional development opportunities. Training begins when new hires join the firm and continues throughout staff careers, consisting of both formal training sessions and more informal on-the-job training within case teams. Typically, new hires participate in orientation training during their first days at the firm, providing an introduction to the firm and delving into technical skills. The firm also hosts global training programs for staff entering new roles, for example new consultants, new managers, and new partners. In addition, regional and global retreats have a strong emphasis on training-related activities. Finally, office-based trainings are offered on an ongoing basis. These include formal training, covering core consulting skills such as problem definition and structuring, research planning, and presentation skills, as well as less formal training offerings such as a Learning Lunch series.\n",
      "Early in their careers, consultants typically do not specialize in one content area, and we encourage consultants to gain exposure to a variety of topics and types of projects early in their tenure. At the same time, consultants can join firm-wide practice areas, focused on specific themes or sectors, to build expertise in the areas they are most interested in. Our senior staff members typically build their platform in two to three practice areas.\n",
      "Each Dalberg region has a staffing coordinator who manages consultants’ project assignments. Project decisions are based on a variety of factors, including consultants’ professional development goals, interests, and availability, and clients’ needs for specific skills and experience. The staffing team does its best to consider consultants’ preferences when making staffing decisions, while balancing these with business and client needs.\n",
      "Consultants should expect to travel while working at Dalberg. The level of travel required varies by office, position, and project, and can be influenced by consultants’ preferences. Travel is often to present findings, work with the client, or conduct on-the-ground research. In addition, on projects where the Dalberg team comprises consultants from multiple offices, some team members may travel to work in-person with their colleagues for a period of time. The duration of travel will vary based on the trip’s purpose and distance traveled. Trips for client meetings or presentations can be as short as one day or night. Trips that require consultants to travel further distances from their home offices may be structured as two to three continuous weeks. While some projects require weekly trips to the clients’ offices, this type of travel is less typical for Dalberg than at many other management consulting firms.\n",
      "Dalberg believes that giving staff opportunities to work across different offices is an important way to create a fulfilling experience for consultants and support knowledge and skill sharing across regions. Cross-office opportunities can take multiple forms, including single project assignments with another office; a short-term transfer for a set time period; or, less commonly, a permanent transfer. Transfer requests, both short-term and permanent, are evaluated on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration employees’ time with the firm, experience, and preferences, as well as Dalberg office needs.\n"

      "During his visit to Singapore, Danish Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen handed over UNLEASH to Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. UNLEASH is a global innovation lab, bringing together 1,000 carefully selected young talents from across the world, to collaborate on ideas and solutions for the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n",
      "“Denmark kick-started this great initiative, and there is no better partner than Singapore to take over. The global SDGs carry the ambition to bring the world we live in closer to the world in which we wish to live. Singapore is known for its foresight, drive, and ability to take action. By passing on the host country torch to Singapore, I am sure that UNLEASH will take yet another important step forward,” said Danish Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen, who was on his first official visit to Singapore.\n",
      "Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong is delighted that Singapore will be the next host. “We each have a valuable contribution to make to sustainable development. We must fulfill the goals of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda, for the next generation to have a brighter and more resilient future. I am happy that Singapore’s private sector will be hosting UNLEASH 2018, and doing their part for the Sustainable Development Agenda. This gathering of young, creative and innovative minds will harness the power of human ingenuity, to create imaginative solutions that achieve the SDGs,” says Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.\n",
      "The UNLEASH program will integrate Singaporean business strongholds, and local ways of living, thinking, and working: “Singapore embodies UNLEASH’s values of innovation, multi-culturalism, and cross-sector partnerships. Singapore has been quick to adopt new technologies and has been noted for its sustainable urban planning, as well as being the greenest metropolis in Asia, making it a perfect location for UNLEASH 2018” says Flemming Besenbacher, chairman of UNLEASH, Carlsberg Group, and the Carlsberg Foundation.\n",
      "UNLEASH 2018 will be a reality due to support from the private sector in Singapore. One of the founding partners for 2018 is DBS Bank. ”At DBS, we are committed to shaping positive change. This includes contributing towards a better future, such as by championing sustainable development and social entrepreneurship. We’re excited about UNLEASH – its ambitious undertaking, bringing together creative young minds passionate about the future, will no doubt spur fresh perspectives and thinking that will further advance the SDGs,” says Sim S. Lim, Country Head for DBS Singapore.\n",
      "UNLEASH has also partnered with Temasek and will be held alongside the Ecosperity Conference on June 5. “We are pleased to welcome UNLEASH as a partner in conjunction with our Ecosperity Conference. Ecosperity brings together CEOs, innovators and thought leaders globally to discuss the latest issues on sustainable growth. We look forward to the many innovative solutions arising from UNLEASH which will bring us a step closer in translating the SDGs into reality,” says Robin Hu, Head of Sustainability & Stewardship Group at Temasek.\n",
      "Deloitte was a partner in the first UNLEASH and will continue its commitment in 2018. Deloitte’s Nordic CEO, Anders Dons, stated “It is a great honor for Deloitte to continue as lead innovation partner and help bring UNLEASH to Singapore. Deloitte will again gather a global team of facilitators to help the talents advance their ideas. To create an impact the world needs to rethink how we do business and leverage the power of innovation – this is exactly what UNLEASH is about and why we are proud to contribute.”\n",
      "During the inaugural UNLEASH in Denmark, 1,000 talents from 129 countries worked on solutions within themes relating to the SDGs. Over the course of nine days, 197 solutions were created and are now being supported by the UNLEASH ecosystem of investors, experts, mentors and more than 200 partner organizations from all over the world. From May 29-June 6, 2018, another 1,000 talents will work on new themes and new challenges. “Just like Denmark influenced the structure and mindset of UNLEASH in 2017, Singapore will inspire new kinds of innovation, new insights, and influence how the talents will work on creating scalable solutions,” says director of UNLEASH and chairman of Dalberg, Henrik Skovby.\n",

      "Human Centered-Design (HCD) is a way of thinking that places the people you're trying to serve and other important stakeholders at the center of the design, innovation and implementation process. The HCD approach to problem-solving is iterative, measurable and results-driven.\n",
      "Social impact and development face significant hurdles that stem from the difficulty in changing user and stakeholder behaviors, the barriers to scaling compelling solutions and the challenge of measuring impact. Human-centered design and its sibling design thinking are well suited to tackling these issues.\n",
      "Human-centered design delivers value to programs by actively engaging end users, providers and other constituencies throughout the development process to ensure that their needs and expectations inform decisions.\n",
      "Despite the appeal of human-centered design, organizations often struggle to integrate design methods and outputs. Our integrated approach brings together rigorous analytical approaches with creative, empathetic and participatory methods to inspire better solutions and plans.\n",
      "When you let people participate in the design process, you find that they often have ingenious ideas about what would really help them. And it’s not a one time thing; it’s an iterative process.  - Melinda Gates\n",
      "Service design helps maintain a cohesive picture of various touch-points with users and stakeholders so they can better coordinate their activities to deliver value on a consistent basis over time.\n",
      "Creative and collaborative methods help engage stakeholders and users, map out new opportunity spaces and align around new agendas, ideas and strategies.\n",
      "System mapping helps visualize dynamic systems that reflect a common understanding of key stakeholders, relationships and feedback loops. This is critical in identifying leverage points and opportunities for collaboration.\n",
      "We use on-site research methods that involve observations and deep-dive interviews, taking place in the contexts and locations in which users (and other stakeholders) live, work and interact.\n",
      "Rapid prototyping accelerates the process for testing assumptions and iterating new product, program or delivery models. It removes risk and increases certainty by engaging users and stakeholders early and often.\n",
      "Pilot testing and implementation validates propositions and lowers the risk of failure for a proposed solution. Supported by the right business strategy and incentive models, pilots are an ideal way to measure business impact through small-scale experimentation.\n",
      "“The easy and the simple are not identical. To discover what is really simple and to act upon the discovery is an exceedingly difficult task. After the artificial and complex is once institutionally established and ingrained in custom and routine, it is easier to walk in the paths that have been beaten than it is, after taking a new point of view, to work out what is practically involved in the new point of view.” \n",
      "Human centered design provides a robust framework for integrating user needs throughout the program design and implementation process. But it can be a challenge to determine when and where to best apply design to your work, particularly if you are unfamiliar with the broad range of design capabilities in the market. This simple guide will get you started.\n",
      "Despite the increased interest in design most development organizations find it difficult to tap local design resources in key markets. We offer a comprehensive framework for strengthening the design ecosystem, identifying key market failures and opportunities to align capacity building with market needs. \n"

      "In Southeast Asia, women are employed predominantly in sectors and jobs that require few or no skills in information and communications technologies (ICT). But, as the ongoing digital revolution transforms the region, many of their jobs are at risk of being automated. The manufacturing and services sectors are becoming digitized. As a result, traditional, low-skilled jobs are declining, and blue-collar jobs are becoming ‘grey-collar.’\n",
      "Looking forward, it is expected that most jobs will require at least basic ICT skills, and women are likely to be left behind in the future workforce because there is little momentum to help them become digitally savvy. Because technology is considered a male domain, girls and women are discouraged from attempting to access ICT training or employment. Those girls and women who do seek to acquire ICT skills must overcome time poverty, mobility constraints, and limited family investment. Successful graduates of training program who seek employment must then combat discriminatory hiring practices. The few women who reach the workplace find and face especially unattractive career prospects with lower wages and fewer promotions.\n",
      "Three parties can contribute to supporting girls’ and women’s ICT skills: policymakers, philanthropies, and private sector businesses. Policymakers can explore new approaches to enable girls and women to access the Internet and ICT tools and training. They can also support gender equality policies in the workplace. Philanthropies can provide research and knowledge sharing to dismantle gender stereotypes around technology, improve ICT training for women, and leverage existing networks to link ICT trainers and employers to ease women’s transition into the workforce. Private sector businesses can provide women basic and applied ICT skills through existing jobs and supply chains, create remote work or telecommuting options, highlight successful women working in ICT and, most importantly, partner with and recruit more women from ICT training programs.\n",
      "Concerted and coordinated action by all three parties can ensure that girls and women are equipped with skills to enter and remain in the future workforce, become economically empowered and help accelerate broader economic growth in Southeast Asia.\n",

      "Pak Soni is a partner on a Blue Swimming Crab (BSC) trapping boat in Indonesia. He makes a third of a boat owner’s take-home pay, which can sometimes be as many as five time more than what a boat hand makes. This amount is barely able to help him subsist or save to buy his own boat and gear. \n",
      "“We use the income from shrimp to cover daily expenses, blue swimming crab to pay for big investments and boat repair, and baitfish to pay for our children’s education. Using this system, we’ve managed to avoid taking on debt.” - Pak Nur, Demak, Indonesia  \n",
      "To understand Pak Soni’s world, we visualized his fishing ecosystem and explored the stakeholder relationships he must navigate. The path to more sustainable fishing behavior is shaped, by the social and economic context of the “fishing group.” When this fishing community is empowered -- with healthy families, strong governance, negotiation power in the market, and a network of collaborators, they can build stewardship for the ocean and take on more risks for growth.\n",

This concept was tested with a group of caletas (coops) in Chole. It allows fisher caletas to post, exchange, and rate products to strengthen collective group power and produce higher value to individual fishers. Participants can share new skills that increase income, diversify livelihoods and mitigate risk, and assist fishers to connect directly to buyers willing to pay sustainable practices and high quality catch.\n",

      "Quality control mechanisms: Fishers install traceability technology on their boats to verify handling, source of product, and hygiene. Buyers can then view the caleta’s profile on the Exchange Platform, to verify product quality, as well a historical performance.\n",
      "Caleta matching service: For an added fee, caletas can enroll in a caleta matching service, where the platform operators suggest quality improvements that past caletas have made that have increased the value of their product, and directly connect the production managers from each caleta for better knowledge exchange.\n",

      "Fisher-Powered Data Collection Program Pilot: We partnered with a provider of a passive GPS tracking technology to design a data collection system that enables fisher collectives and governments to monitor data and build cost-effective strategies for sustainable fishing practices in Indonesia. Fishers deposit money for the device but then “earn out” ownership through continuous data generation.\n",
      "Enrollment & onboarding strategy: Fishers register for the program with their local collective, qualifying to purchase subsidized GPS devices. The program includes an “earn out” feature where fishers pay for a portion of the device upfront and earn out full ownership through continued data collection. The device allows them to better track their own fishing patterns as well providing peace of mind in emergency situations. \n",
      "Mobilization & training: The technological provider installs the passive GPS trackers on fishers’ boats and explains the benefits of the data such as fisher locations, gear and fuel use, and time spent on the water. The GPS verifies gear type use and respect for marine closure areas, which enables fisher to capture subsidies, if available, related to sustainable fishing practices. \n",
      "Data generation & use: The technological provider manages the data and generates fisher report cards for individual fishers, which are then distributed through the local fishers group. The report cards link fishing costs to seasonality, weather, and on-the-water practices, helping fishers improve efficiency and understand the connection between sustainable practices and improved stock health.

      "The phenomenon of “Impact Investing”, investments with the intention to generate social and environmental impact alongside a financial return, is growing rapidly in South Africa. It is increasingly recognised that entrepreneurs will have an extraordinary influence on both the South African economy and solving what have previously appeared to be intractable social challenges. Despite this realisation, finding and securing investment opportunities in South Africa, is difficult. Investors have reported that the lack of “investable opportunities” with a track record is a major constraint to scaling the impact investing industry.\n",
      "Entrepreneurs that are focused on education, health care, housing, food security, financial inclusion, energy, water, and other climate adaptation/change issues are critical to creating a more socially just country. Yet, these businesses like many others also face a broad spectrum of challenges when trying to grow. These include amongst others:\n",
      " Identification of and securing access to target markets;\n",
      " A clear revenue generation model, financial plan and strategic direction which leads to;\n",
      " Difficulty in securing access to capital to fund growth in either capacity or different geographies.\n",
      "To address some of these challenges, Impact Amplifier has created the Investment Readiness Accelerator. Its third iteration, this Accelerator is a three-month long programme designed for impact business, to prepare for expansion and funding.\n",
      "The programme will offer entrepreneurs the skills, knowledge, documentation and support required to secure investment for their businesses. The Programme addresses:\n",
      " Constructing an Impact Case;\n",
      " Market access, sales and distribution;\n",
      " Strategic planning;\n",
      " Financial modelling and planning;\n",
      " Writing an Investment case to secure funding;\n",
      " Pitching to investors; and\n",
      " Connecting with partners in the business ecosystem, including multinational companies, NGOs and the public sector.\n",
      "These subjects provide the needed skills and practical application for the participants to become investment ready. Although the Programme is designed to support investment readiness, it has also been structured to create networks for the participants both amongst themselves and between the lecturers and other stakeholders. These networks can form an important part of the entrepreneur’s future success and as such have been consciously woven through the programme’s delivery process.\n",
      "The programme is structured in two distinct phases. The first phase is designed as seven modules, one to two are delivered every two weeks over a three-month period. Each module will include a combination of lectures, individual coaching, group discussions and presentations. In between each module there will be a range of assignments required to progress the core tasks being reviewed. Each entrepreneur will be supported by a team of Impact Amplifier Fellows and senior mentors throughout the programme to assist them in completing each step. One of the unique aspects of the Accelerator is the inclusion of the Fellows. These are Masters and Phd students who will provide daily support to the businesses in completing each of the modules while the senior mentor will provide overall strategic direction. The structure has been designed to combine expert, peer-to-peer learning, and pragmatic assignments that provide the basis for developing an investment case for support.\n",
      "The second phase, post the structured Accelerator, available to select businesses is for an additional nine months. During this period, the Impact Amplifier team will assist each business on a one-on-one basis to secure the resources required to grow.\n",
      "Impact Amplifier is seeking applications from any type of impact business that has the potential for growth. \n",
      "The primary criteria that will be used to shortlist the applicants will include, but not be exclusive to:\n",
      " The strength and experience of the management team and the precedent set by the team in terms of co-operation, achieving business goals, as well as developing a cohesive value proposition;\n",
      " Ability of the business to be commercially viable and create long term and sustainable value through social/environmental impact;\n",
      " The social/environmental issue the business is addressing. How material is this issue and what impact will the business have on it;\n",
      " Is the business model scalable and replicable; and\n",
      " Likelihood of the business to benefit from the programme and support other businesses participating.\n",
      "The programme is not for ideating stage entrepreneurs. The table below reflects the various stages businesses move through from idea to scale. We will only be accepting businesses from the 3rd phase to the 6th phase.\n",
      "Entrepreneurs from anywhere in South Africa may apply. However, the group meetings will be held in Cape Town.   Businesses from outside Cape Town must attend the first two sessions physically and then thereafter can participate remotely.  \n",

      "Smallholder farmers have become the most important piece of the global agricultural system. Small farmers feed close to 80 percent of the total population in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa and support the livelihoods of nearly 2 billion people worldwide.\n",
      "This community of farmers sit at a critical nexus between survival and global opportunity. With 500 million farm holdings in the developing world, smallholder farmers typically cultivate less than two hectares (4.4 acres) of land for subsistence and earn less than $2 per day. Most smallholder farmers farm out of necessity not opportunity. These are families who have few alternatives except to grow there own food and to sell whatever excess they can.\n",
      "Although smallholders dominate the production of cocoa and coffee, and play a key role in tea, bananas, and sugar, particularly in Africa, few have the luxury of participating in larger supply chains for cash crops. As these farmers already have access to land, the means of production, and a keen desire for more lucrative crops, marrying their needs with the increasing demand for food could not be more opportune. Global food demand is expected to grow at an astronomical rate – 59 to 98 percent by 2050.\n",
      "This intersection of supply and demand has not gone missed for both multinationals and local companies alike who are increasingly looking to smallholders as a sourcing option for their supply of agricultural commodities. Larger buyers of agricultural products have recognized the opportunity smallholder farmers offer to their supply chains. Programs and operating models such as Nando’s “Peri Peri Ethical Sourcing Initiative,” the Export Trading Group, as well as Unilever’s “ Livelihoods for Smallholder Farmers,” provide evidence that it is possible to both integrate smallholder farmers on commercially competitive terms while also making a sustainable impact on rural poverty.\n",
      "Although integrating smallholder farmers into large supply chains is opportunistic, it comes with multiple risks. These farmers typically have lower yields than commercial farms based on limited: technical expertise, working capital to invest in fertilizers, pest and disease control, and access to irrigation infrastructure. Additionally, smallholder farmers often have limited experience with the contractual obligations of cash crops or have little trust in commercial buyers based on prior experiences. These two factors lead to “side selling” where the farmers sell crops to buyers other than those contracted, which makes supply chain management more complex.\n",
      "Smallholders also offer a range of benefits to larger commercial buyers. When networked effectively, production can be scaled up and down with limited additional infrastructure and other related costs. They also offer the opportunity to impact rural poverty, enhance financial inclusion, and grow consumer markets. Additionally, in labor-intensive supply chains such as horticulture and higher quality grade and niche markets for fair trade, organic, or boutique markets, smallholder farmers can compete with larger suppliers.\n",
      "In order for smallholder farmers, particularly in Africa, to fill the increasing demand for food delivered via large supply chains both the risks must be minimized and the benefits enhanced.\n",
      "First and foremost large buyers have to recognize that purchasing from small farmers is not business as usual. These commercial buyers have to figure out mechanisms to aggregate these farmers to reduce the cost of logistics. This usually means working through cooperatives or collaboratively with other structures established by the public sector and NGO community. They must consider how to provide technical support to increase yields, access to micro loans for both the seasonal inputs (fertilizer, pest and disease control) and irrigation systems, and financial transactions outside the traditional banking system.\n",
      "They also need to offer a fixed price prior to planting and a guaranteed off take agreement, which allows the smallholder farmers to plan and have some security of income. Farming under any circumstances is a high risk endeavor. When it is undertaken by farmers who have no resilience to shocks or chronic stress, the consequences of failure are not simply financial, but food security, healthcare, education and housing.\n",
      "Smallholder farmers could very well be the only answer to feeding our increasing population, but just as importantly they offer the extraordinary opportunity to build an economy, which is inclusive in nature, where growth and prosperity are not the exclusive domain of the few.\n",

      "\n",
      "\tEvery weekday, they stream into the bright brick buildings of Musanze Polytechnic, a government vocational school that has traditionally taught skills like plumbing, carpentry, and hospitality. But in the past year, the school began teaching something extra: a curriculum from the Strengthening Rural Youth Development through Enterprise (STRYDE) program.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tA partnership between TechnoServe and Mastercard Foundation, STRYDE is a rural youth entrepreneurship training program that gives young people the skills to identify and act on economic opportunities in their communities.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tThe first phase of the program trained over 15,000 youth in East Africa and resulted in an 80 percent drop in the rate of participants who were either unemployed or not in school. On average, participants more than doubled their incomes, increasing them by 133 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tBut with 11 million young people entering the African workforce each year, the STRYDE program needed to scale up in order to achieve greater impact.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tIn 2014, the program began working with institutional partners like vocational schools, universities, civil society organizations, and prisons – entities that routinely reached thousands of young people, and could continue training activities well after STRYDE’s official end.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tThe timing couldn’t have been better for Musanze Polytechnic, one of STRYDE’s 77 institutional partners so far in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, and Rwanda.\n",
      "\n",
      "\t“Many graduates would come back to us, needing help to find jobs,” explains Betty Niyigena, head of the school’s entrepreneurship department. “Students had the right skills, but didn’t know how to make their own business. They would ask for jobs from the government but fail to get employment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\tLast year, TechnoServe trained 19 Musanze Polytechnic staff members on the STRYDE approach, and they soon began incorporating these lessons into the school’s coursework.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tThe process was not without challenges. Extra classes meant expanded school hours and additional teacher time. The thick STRYDE manual was difficult to produce and distribute on tight budgets, and classes often faced material shortages.\n",
      "\n",
      "\t“The students were very attentive, very motivated, and right away started thinking of some business ideas,” said teacher Jean Claude Twagirimana. “We had been giving them theories, but there were no practical methods to start a business...After being trained [in STRYDE], they felt very confident.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\tDozens of Musanze Polytechnic students have now been trained in the STRYDE entrepreneurship approach, and have started businesses in baking, carpentry, juice-making, and a range of other products and services. The class was so effective, in fact, that the school incorporated additional STRYDE coursework and made the approach a mandatory part of its curriculum.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tEight other institutional partners are instituting the STRYDE curriculum across Rwanda, and have already trained nearly 4,000 students. With the country’s median age around 18 years old, and 125,000 youth entering its labor market each year, these kinds of scaled-up, self-sustaining approaches are critical to ensuring meaningful employment for the next generation in Rwanda – and Africa.\n",

I found TechnoServe's approach to addressing these challenges highly effective.

      "MozaCajú has helped to catalyze the Mozambican cashew nut industry by harnessing global market demand for premium cashew and addressing obstacles throughout the value chain, such as production and processing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tMozambique is a beautiful country with extensive coasts along the Indian Ocean, lowlands that grow into highlands, and the impressive Eastern Great Rift Valley. Surrounded by such a dramatic landscape, you could be forgiven for not noticing the even more dynamic changes that Mozambique’s landscapes and livelihoods have experienced in recent years. In only four years, an additional 542,807 cashew tree seedlings have been planted, and more than 80,000 hectares of farmland are newly brimming with cashew trees and red-gold cashew apples.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tZooming in from the landscape to the household, the change is even more dramatic. Through the work of the MozaCajú project, which launched in 2014 and closes early this year, more than 23,000 farmers have been trained in the skills and practices they need to build more prosperous livelihoods from their cashew farms. In fact, the program, a collaboration between TechnoServe and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, has helped their yields to increase by an average of 53 percent, and their incomes by 66 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tOne key component to this vast change within the Mozambican cashew nut industry is taking place off the farm, in only a few buildings across the country: processing factories.\n",
      "\n",
      "By 2008, Mozambique had advanced from processing zero cashew nut to becoming the largest processor in Africa.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tOnce the world’s leading producer of cashew nut, Mozambique’s production sharply decreased as civil war, aging trees, and market obstacles inhibited growth. Raw nuts were exported to India and other nations for processing, taking much of the products’ added value potential with them. In 2002, TechnoServe began working within the country’s cashew industry, aiming to capture more of its value locally. By 2008, Mozambique had advanced from processing zero cashew nut to processing almost half of its production, making it one of the largest processors in Africa (and the fourth-largest processor in the world).\n",
      "\n",
      "\tWhen MozaCajú – “The Mozambican Cashew Project” – was launched, its aim was to accelerate this growth and impact by harnessing global market demand for premium cashew while addressing obstacles throughout the value chain such as production, inputs, processing, finance, and marketing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tWhile the project catalyzed impressive change at all levels of the value chain, processors were identified as a particularly crucial link. Without quality processing, even the increased yields wouldn’t help farmers tap into the market demand for high-quality cashew. Over four years, however, processors like Condor Nuts worked tirelessly alongside MozaCajú staff to transform their operations and make market connections with leading buyers such as Car Nut, a buyer for Costco.\n",
      "\n",
      "MozaCajú helped Condor to track the movements of product and personnel at every stage of production, an important part of safety, quality, and transparency.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tMany of the major transformations that Condor Nuts underwent through the program were realized through upgrades to its operations as the company improved its food safety management in an effort to become HACCP certified. This certification ensures buyers that appropriate controls are in place to decrease hazards and increase safety and quality throughout every step of production. Working with a food safety company, TechnoServe staff developed training guides and manuals for updating participating plants’ operations in order to replace low-efficiency, retroactive quality controls with processes that proactively identify and avoid food safety hazards.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tOnce Condor’s management was on board with the new procedures, MozaCajú technicians held training sessions with workers over several months, helping them to understand the risks of production as well as their roles in managing them. They even helped Condor to draft tailored registration sheets to track the movement of people and products within the factory (a crucial step towards traceability within the plant’s production), and to ensure the maintenance of their new policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tWith the new system in place, MozaCaju staff took a step back and let Condor take charge, only performing routine monitoring visits to ensure top-quality compliance. After their participation in the project, Condor became HACCP certified, paving the way to connections with new, more demanding buyers for their nuts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Market connections facilitated by MozaCajú have resulted in over 1,000 additional tons of cashew kernel sales for participating Mozambican processors.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tWhile some international buyers had previously sourced cashew from Mozambique, they had ultimately switched to other suppliers due to quality control issues. Having worked with processors like Condor to improve their quality standards, MozaCajú aimed to reforge these market linkages in an effort to create a broad market system in which Mozambique’s farmers and processors could thrive.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tIn 2015, MozaCajú contacted Caro Nut – a nut roaster and wholesaler that supplies cashew products to the major U.S. retailer Costco – and invited them to Mozambique to learn more about the Mozambican cashew industry. During their visit, MozaCajú introduced Caro Nut  to several Mozambican processors, and in 2016, Caro Nut placed its first order of cashew kernel from Condor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tMozaCajú helped to ensure the quality of these initial orders by checking on the containers – looking for variances between grades and conducting random nut counts – before they were shipped to Caro Nut’s roasting facility in Fresno, California. Since then, Caro Nut has ordered several containers of cashew per year from Condor and other other Mozambican processors, which now contribute to nearly half of Caro Nut’s total cashew sourced from Africa.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tIn total, market connections facilitated by MozaCajú have resulted in over 1,000 additional tons of cashew kernel sales for participating Mozambican processors.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a grant from MozaCajú, Condor bought Mozambique's first machine to extract raw cashew nut liquid, allowing them to utilize frequently discarded byproducts and diversify their production.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tOnce businesses like Condor are operating within stable processes and markets, they begin to have room to innovate and grow. In 2015, MozaCaju launched its matching grant fund, which provided funding for a variety of actors in the cashew supply chain, from processors, to farmers, to agro-dealers. The inspiration behind the grant was to give these enterprises access to equipment or technologies that would have otherwise been unavailable due to high cost or risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tCondor applied for the grant to purchase a Cashew Nut Shell Liquid extraction machine. Cashew shells are typically discarded or burned as an inefficient fuel after being removed during processing. However, the shell contains two useful byproducts – one is the extracted liquid, and the other the dried husk that remains.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tThanks to the grant, Condor was able to buy the first such extractor in Mozambique. They are already turning a profit from sale of the extracted liquid – which can be utilized in various industrial processes – and the dry shell can be burned as a cleaner, more efficient fuel. Condor is even piloting the sale of cooking stoves that are fueled by these “cashew shell cakes,” which they are providing to their employees on credit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tOverall, MozaCaju awarded 13 grants to 11 grantees, leveraging over $1 million in investments along the value chain.\n",
      "\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\t\tTechnoServe’s approach starts with an in-depth assessment to identify sectors where smallholder farmers and local entrepreneurs have the potential to greatly increase their earnings – from livestock production in Central America to cashew processing in West Africa. We then identify market failures, inefficiencies and opportunities across a market system. We leverage knowledge and experience from similar market interventions and adapt them to the local context. Critically, we act as a catalyst at multiple points in the market, working with stakeholders including smallholder farmers, local businesses, governments, financial institutions and private sector players to incentivize inclusive market growth.\r\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\t\tWe focus on catalyzing markets and market systems whose participants have the ability to improve competitiveness and performance over time. While many of our projects deliver services directly, a growing number of initiatives focus on facilitating local market actors – from government agencies to businesses along the supply chain—to deliver ongoing training, services and technical advice. Our role is to help build the skills of local service providers and connect them with farmers and entrepreneurs who need their services. These relationships strengthen market systems to deliver inclusive financial benefits long after TechnoServe leaves.\r\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\t\tFor decades, TechnoServe has been a leader in leveraging corporate partnerships to create shared value. Our mission is built on a proven principle: aligning business incentives with local development needs is one of the most effective ways to ensure scalable, long-term change. In 2016, one of our projects – a partnership with The Coca-Cola Company and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation – was named winner of the U.S. Department of State’s P3 Impact Award, which recognizes the world's most innovative and impactful public-private partnerships. The project strengthened Coca-Cola’s local supply chain in East Africa while helping local fruit farmers increase their incomes and secure a stable market for their fruit. TechnoServe is proud to design and help implement similar win-win solutions with many of the world’s leading corporations, including Nespresso, Walmart, Kellogg, Danone and Syngenta.\r\n",

      "TechnoServe is working with public and private partners across West Africa to transform the cashew industry from tree to trade, providing opportunities for farmers, entrepreneurs, processors and other stakeholders to prosper.\n",
      "Creating a competitive, inclusive and sustainable cashew industry begins on the farm. In Nigeria, TechnoServe partnered with the Walmart Foundation to help raise the incomes of more than 10,000 smallholder cashew farmers through training in good agronomic practices and improved access to markets. In a country where only 15 percent of cashew farmers are women, the project focused heavily on increasing women’s engagement, by working with community leaders to encourage women to join, among other tactics. These efforts resulted in a high female participation rate of 42 percent.\n",
      "“Cashew has turned my life around and TechnoServe has made my dream come true,” says Aishat Achimi, who was surprised by the difference pruning and other best practices made on her neglected cashew farm, which she had inherited when her father died. After consolidating her bountiful harvest with other farmers in her cooperative, Aishat was able to earn enough extra income to buy the materials to build a new house, fulfilling a long-time dream.\n",
      "By adopting improved practices and selling their cashews at higher prices through cooperatives, farmers participating in the three-year program, which closed in November 2016, increased their incomes by an average of 43 percent, or $164 per year.\n",
      "In Benin, TechnoServe is working to strengthen and expand the entire cashew sector into an inclusive economic growth engine for the country. A comprehensive five-year value chain project, BeninCajù works with both producers and processors, as well as a constellation of market players surrounding them. TechnoServe is supporting processors every step of the way – from planning and constructing factories to accessing finance and connecting with international buyers – in order to triple the nation’s domestic processing capacity, ensure a stable market for smallholder farmers, and create 3,400 new jobs.\n",
      "As in Nigeria, BeninCajù prioritizes women’s participation at every level, targeting 70 percent of the new jobs for women. In early 2016, BeninCajù supported the launch of Fludor Benin, a state-of-the-art factory with a processing capacity of 15,000 metric tons of cashew. Women employees fill nearly 600 of the processing facility’s 700 new positions.\n",
      "In 2017, BeninCajù is expanding the industry further by focusing on a new market opportunity – cashew fruit juice. Utilizing the nutritious but overlooked cashew apple, the vast majority of which is discarded on the farm, the project is working with processors to produce and commercialize cashew juice under the label Sweet Benin. This new product has enormous potential for long-term financial gains for farmers and businesses, demonstrating how an entire sector can be harnessed as an engine of growth and positive change. \n",
      "On his coffee farm in rural Kenya, John Karuga Mwangi lays down mulch, makes his own compost, and uses integrated pest management to protect his coffee. But just a few years ago, when he took over the farm after being unable to find steady work in Nairobi, he didn’t know how to use these techniques – or much else about growing coffee. \n",
      "John learned these skills through the AAA Quality Program, which Nespresso and TechnoServe brought to Kenya and Ethiopia in 2014. The program’s goal is to improve the quality, volume and sustainability of the coffee produced by local farmers, allowing them to earn higher prices from premium buyers like Nespresso. “Improving productivity and the quality of coffee harvests is a triple win – benefiting our customers, the environment and paving the way to higher incomes for farmers,” said Nespresso CEO Jean-Marc Duvoisin.\n",
      "One important element of the project is the AAA Academy, which provides farmers like John with two years of training on climate-smart agricultural techniques that increase yields and improve resilience in the face of changing weather patterns. Participants learn how to produce and use compost, for example, to improve the soil’s moisture retention – an important step as rainfall becomes more erratic. The program’s focus is on practices that are not only environmentally sustainable, but also profitable and inexpensive to adopt, making it likelier that farmers will use them over the long run. \n",
      "To date, 29,481 farmers, 39 percent of whom are women, have received training. A recent survey in Kenya found that 55 percent of the farmers used at least half of the featured practices by the time they completed the AAA Academy – compared to zero percent before the program began. \n",
      "In 2016, with support from the World Bank’s BioCarbon Fund and the International Finance Corporation, the project launched a new initiative, in which coffee growers will plant a combined total of 1 million trees on their farms by the year 2020. These trees will help to reduce atmospheric carbon and protect against soil erosion, and the shade they provide to coffee plants will improve the crop’s quality. \n",
      "Sustainability and quality improvements are not only important at the farm level, however. AAA mill advisors have helped the managers and employees of 145 local, low-tech processing facilities called wet mills to improve their business and processing skills, enhance the quality of the coffee they produce, and meet Nespresso’s social and environmental sustainability standards. These improvements are good for workers and the environment, but they are also good for business, reducing operating expenses and allowing the wet mills to sell their high-quality coffee at higher prices to Nespresso. \n",
      "The changes are having a real impact for farmers like John. Between 2013 and 2015, his yields and income grew fivefold, allowing him to pay the school fees for his three children. He now serves as representative on his cooperative’s board, as well. “I would like to see farmers looking like me, able to pay for all their needs with coffee proceeds,” he said.\n",
      "Santos Velasquez, his wife Irma, and their three adult children all work together tending a herd of 39 cows on their large farm in Nueva Guinea, Nicaragua. Like most of Nicaragua’s 135,000 livestock farmers, the Velasquez family used to follow a low-cost model of farming, which typically results in low productivity and low quality of milk. Despite Nicaragua having the largest livestock industry in Central America, with 5 million head of cattle, most dairy farmers are poor, and are reluctant to invest in technologies and inputs that can boost productivity.\n",
      "TechnoServe’s Ganadería Empresarial (GANE) project, set out to improve the productivity and quality of the dairy and beef produced by small farmers across Nicaragua. Between 2012 and 2016, the U.S. Department of Agriculture- funded project trained more than 5,500 farmers who increased their production by 28 percent. Farmers adopted the practices they learned at high rates, thanks to TechnoServe’s adult learning methodology and follow-up technical assistance on the farm.\n",
      "Farmer training is critical, but it is only one component in strengthening a value chain. GANE helped farmers access financing for inputs, such as mineral salts and improved pasture seed, and infrastructure, such as watering systems and electric fences, which would improve their cows health and productivity. Working with two financial institutions, the project designed special loan products with the most favorable interest rates and repayment terms available to smallholder farmers, to facilitate these smart investments.\n",
      "The Velasquez family obtained a $5,000 loan to construct a roof over their cattle’s corral and purchase fencing material to create paddocks for improved grazing. Their cows’ milk yield increased from 3.5 liters per cow per day before joining the project to 5.5 liters after. Thanks to the improved pastures Santos planted and fenced, the herd is healthier and reproducing at a higher rate – which means more cows are producing milk at any given time.\n",
      "GANE also worked to improve market access by helping farmers achieve scale through producer organizations (POs). GANE worked with 25 POs to help them improve milk collection and processing, develop market linkages and build management capacity. TechnoServe’s team helped these POs negotiate 38 new sales agreements, generating $4.6 million in new revenue.\n",
      "As a result of increasing milk yields and cow reproductive rates while improving their market linkages, the Velasquez family is now earning an additional $1,250 per year. The new income allowed the family to pool resources with neighboring farmers to bring electricity to their community.\n",
      "“With electricity in our homes, we now feel better,” says Santos. “We can now charge our mobile phones every day. Before, we had to travel to town every three days in order to charge them. Today we are able to communicate better.”\n",
      "Horsin Kalikeka weaves through the streets of Ndola, Zambia, delivering eggs using a specially outfitted bicycle. On a typical day, he sells 2,400 eggs to about a hundred local market vendors (ntembas) as a new bike peddler for Goldenlay, Zambia’s largest egg producer and distributor. This allows the 26-year-old to earn between $120 and $150 a month, which is twice the local minimum wage. \n",
      "Goldenlay piloted this new distribution model in 2016 with support from TechnoServe’s Technical Assistance Facility, or TAF. The cost-effective innovation increases Goldenlay’s sales by bypassing the middlemen – passing savings down to small-scale retailers while increasing poor consumers’ access to protein-rich food. \n",
      "Though seemingly simple, this innovation was a result of in-depth research and detailed planning by the Technical Assistance Facility. Implemented by TechnoServe since 2011, TAF has a mandate to increase economic and physical access to food for low-income Africans by providing technical assistance to the portfolio companies of the African Agriculture Fund (AAF). \n",
      "The AAF is a $246 million private equity fund that was created to address food security challenges in Africa through investment in agriculture and food processing. Running on a budget of $11 million over seven years, TAF provides strategic support to companies in AAF’s portfolio to improve their operations or facilitate changes in their operating models by engaging other actors in the value chain. \n",
      "TAF’s work in nine countries across Africa demonstrates the synergistic impact of technical assistance coupled with financial investment. For Goldenlay, the dual approach helped the company expand production from 250,000 to 450,000 eggs per day. In just six months, the bicycle distribution pilot created 50 new jobs, benefited over 1,800 ntemba owners and exceeded Goldenlay’s sales target tenfold. On the opposite end of the value chain, TAF is working with Goldenlay to transform its soya supply for chicken feed through an outgrower model that is helping hundreds of local smallholder farmers increase their incomes. \n",
      "Each TAF intervention is designed to ensure meaningful impact on food security and a win-win for the business and beneficiaries. As a company like Goldenlay embeds a new and profitable business model, it is likely to scale the innovation, and other market players may replicate it, ultimately expanding the model’s reach to more poor producers, consumers and employees.\n",
      "By the end of 2016, TAF has worked with 10 AAF portfolio companies on 42 impactful interventions, enabling the agribusinesses to reach more than 16,000 low-income beneficiaries. Seeking to contribute to broader learning on how technical assistance can boost investment in the agriculture sector to combat food insecurity, TAF released a report documenting learning from its first five years of operations.\n",
      "Sati Bai and her husband Ganesh Mehra grow wheat and other crops on their half hectare of land in Madhya Pradesh state in central India. Yet scant rainfall over the past few years coupled with poor soil health have meant low harvests, making it difficult for the couple to produce and sell enough to provide for basic needs.\n",
      "Across rural India, TechnoServe is working to improve livelihoods for farming families like Sati and Ganesh’s while increasing their long-term resilience to climate change. In the face of increasingly erratic droughts and heatwaves in the state of Madhya Pradesh, TechnoServe is working with the Kellogg Company to train smallholders in climate-smart agricultural practices that can increase productivity, reduce costs and improve long-term growing conditions for wheat, maize, soy and other crops.\n",
      "The project promotes a package of sustainable practices, including planting trees around fields to prevent soil erosion, sequester carbon and provide shade. Farmers also learn to prepare organic fertilizers and pest repellents using locally available natural materials. The low cost of these inputs, compared to their chemical counterparts, helps to ensure long-term adoption by farmers, increasing productivity and bringing them financial benefits, while also improving soil and environmental conditions.\n",
      "TechnoServe and Kellogg are working with farming families in Madhya Pradesh, India, to increase their economic and environmental resilience.\n",
      "Combined with the other good agricultural practices taught through the project, these measures are making a tangible difference for families. Using sustainable techniques, Sati and Ganesh were able to harvest and sell 50 percent more wheat during the last growing season, easing their family’s financial strain. \n",
      "In 2016, the project worked with over 1,300 farmers across Madhya Pradesh, helping them generate more than $1 million in increased revenues. \n",
      "TechnoServe is similarly training farmers in climate-smart practices in the arid region of Rajasthan, India. Farmers here have long cultivated guar, a drought-resistant legume native to India which is used to create thickening agents in food and other products. \n",
      "TechnoServe and Solvay partnered through the Sustainable Guar Initiative (SGI) in Bikaner District, Rajasthan, to demonstrate that guar can be sustainably grown at scale. Launched in May 2015, the two-year project has trained more than 2,500 farmers in climate-smart practices, such as preparing organic inputs using cow dung and urine, and facilitated the planting of more than 12,000 trees on elevated land features to help conserve both soil and water. Overall, the integrated intervention helped guar farmers increase their incomes by an average 27 percent, in an area where many families, seeing little rain, had lost hope of earning a profit.\n",
      "In addition to promoting sustainable farming practices for higher incomes, both projects are strengthening household food security by training women to establish organic kitchen gardens. Though women in rural India are heavily involved in agricultural production, they are largely excluded from decision-making around farming and finances. Kitchen gardens allow women to provide fresh and nutritious vegetables for their families while saving money on food. They can also earn additional income by selling surplus vegetables at market, giving the women a more active role in their family’s financial decision-making. \n",
      "TechnoServe’s emphasis on promoting the inclusion of women in agriculture, and the use of effective, efficient and environmentally friendly practices, is helping farming families in India sustainably enhance food and economic security despite unpredictable weather. \n",
      "As a professionally trained chef, 26-year-old Celeste Fonseca had no problem handling the heat in the kitchen, but navigating the business world was a trial by fire. After Celeste opened Brunoise, a culinary academy in her home city of Guatemala City, Guatemala, she struggled to organize the business’s messy finances or to calculate profits.\n",
      "Realizing that she lacked the tools she needed to make her business succeed, she applied for Crece Tu Empresa (Spanish for \"Grow Your Business\"). A business accelerator implemented by TechnoServe in partnership with the Citi Foundation, Crece seeks to develop enterprises run by youth in urban El Salvador and Guatemala.\n",
      "While Crece works with urban entrepreneurs who have already launched their businesses, it takes a page from a TechnoServe youth program operating in a different context. Strengthening Rural Youth Development through Enterprise, or STRYDE, is our flagship youth entrepreneurship and workforce development program, developed for rural youth in East Africa who have scarce opportunities. The curriculum is delivered in seven modules over three months, followed by nine months of aftercare during which the graduates receive additional support to start a business, find a job or apply their new business skills on the family farm. \n",
      "A critical part of STRYDE’s efficacy is its focus personal effectiveness – building self-awareness, setting goals and developing communication skills. As the Economist noted in an article featuring TechnoServe’s work with youth in Rwanda, “the paucity for business [in Africa] is not due to a shortage of opportunities to make money. In fact, given a small nudge new entrepreneurs seem able to make it hand over fist.” Tharcienne Ahunkuye, a 26-year-old Rwandan entrepreneur, had been unemployed for several years before joining STRYDE. With training from TechnoServe, she started her own egg farm, and is now selling eggs in neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo. She explains that what she needed was just a structure around which to outline her goals and apply her ambition to, and the confidence to carry it out. “I knew it could be a good business because I had seen others doing it, but I didn’t know where to start,” she said.\n",
      "Now in its second phase, STRYDE seeks to provide skills training to 63,000 youth by 2019. TechnoServe is training partner organizations, such as vocational institutions and prisons, to deliver the training to 40 percent of participants, ensuring the model creates ongoing impact and reaches more rural youth long after the project’s end. In 2016, STRYDE helped nearly 4,600 youth in Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda and Tanzania generate over $1.75 million in financial benefits.\n",
      "In its second phase, STRYDE is focused on ensuring sustainable impact by strengthening the capacity of local partner institutions – such as vocational training institutes, government youth centers and prisons – to deliver the training to East African youth.\n",
      "Building on the success and learning from STRYDE, Crece Tu Empresa is helping youth like Celeste succeed in urban Central America. Results from the first cohort of Crece Tu Empresa report an average sales increase of 92 percent. TechnoServe has also adapted the model to help young entrepreneurs in mining communities in South America to create businesses both within and beyond mining supply chains.\n",
      "Through her work with CRECE staff, Celeste has cut her spending by 20 percent, brought on two new chefs, and logged 275 percent growth in sales. She wants to open more branches of her academy throughout Guatemala, providing training and employment for other enterprising young people.\n",
      "Chikondi Matiki conducts quality assurance at Valid Nutrition – a manufacturer of ready-to-use nutritious foods in Malawi.\n",
      "Food processing is a significant driver of local economies, creating supplier linkages for millions of small-scale farmers and helping elevate rural incomes across East Africa, where over 124 million people lack access to food. However, small and growing local processors often face difficulties producing high-quality products that meet food safety standards and regulatory requirements.\n",
      "Solutions for African Food Enterprises (SAFE), a TechnoServe program in partnership with U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and Partners in Food Solutions (PFS), aims to increase the competitiveness of the African food processing sector and expand the availability of affordable and nutritious foods using two primary intervention strategies: customized technical assistance provided to individual processors, and sector-wide trainings (SWTs) provided to food processors and other sector stakeholders.\n",
      "Since 2012, SAFE has delivered customized technical assistance to 124 small and growing African food processors by facilitating the transfer of technology and knowledge between these companies and skilled volunteer experts from PFS’s corporate partners (General Mills, Cargill, Royal DSM, Bühler, the Hershey Company and Ardent Mills). In turn, these processors have created 382 new jobs and sold more than 55,800 metric tons of improved nutritious foods. \n",
      "The second component, sector-wide trainings, allows SAFE to deliver knowledge to more food processors, effecting broader change across the industry. SWTs are one- to two-day events on targeted knowledge gaps in the food processing industry, such as fortification, business strategy, marketing and quality control management. Led by TechnoServe staff and other technical experts, SWTs attract a wide range of enterprises – from farmer cooperatives to large-scale companies – as well as stakeholders from the wider food processing ecosystem, such as input suppliers and government officials. The events provide opportunities for hands-on training, knowledge transfer and networking. \n",
      "Seeking to ensure long-term impact, the SAFE team in Kenya developed a set of learning manuals in 2016 based on content delivered through SWTs. The manuals – on new product development, fortification and business strategy – are geared toward learning institutions and other practitioner audiences. TechnoServe made two manuals available online as e-books to encourage wide distribution. \n",
      "To date, SAFE teams have conducted 50 trainings in business strategy and technical areas, including good manufacturing practices, food fortification, processing, aflatoxin control and milling technology. These trainings have reached more than 1,350 individuals from 1,028 different processors.\n",
      "SAFE's impact extends beyond the businesses, to benefit millions of employees, farmers and consumers. The food processors receiving customized assistance through the program provide market opportunities for more than 973,000 smallholder farmers, who support an estimated 5 million family members.\n",
      "As Emiliano Bello gazes out over his fields – neat rows bursting with green spinach and cilantro – it is hard to believe that this land once seemed to offer no future for his family. In Mexico, smallholder farmers often suffer from stagnating productivity due to insufficient access to the information, technology and markets their farms need to thrive. When one season’s crop failed, Emiliano was forced to make a treacherous journey to seek income across the border in the United States in order to provide for his children.\n",
      "Unhealthy market systems affect companies as well as farming families. When only large farming operations have the resources to provide quality produce, buyers can become reliant on just a few growers, sacrificing freshness and sustainability in their sourcing.\n",
      "TechnoServe is working with a host of private sector partners to tackle these challenges, strengthening companies’ supply chains as well as the local economies where they work. In Mexico, TechnoServe and the Walmart Mexico Foundation, teamed up to form the Mexico Smallholder Farmer Initiative, creating better economic opportunities for smallholder farmers by providing the tools they need to increase their incomes, not only as farmers, but as businesspeople.\n",
      "When Emiliano joined the initiative in 2012, he learned best agricultural practices that helped transform the land he had previously been forced to abandon into a lush farm. He learned practices to improve the quality and quantity of his crops, and to meet strict standards that allow him to sell to new markets, including large-scale retailers. Together with the other members of his farmer organization, Emiliano learned to negotiate with buyers, ensuring a high price for their high-quality produce.\n",
      "“Today I know that I can pass on something more than debts to my children. I can give them a place in an honest company created by farmers,” he said. “Before, we looked at ourselves as peasants. Now we are entrepreneurs.”\n",
      "Between 2011 and 2016, the partnership between TechnoServe and the Walmart Mexico Foundation trained 5,500 smallholder farmers and generated $4 million in sales of fruits and vegetables. The initiative’s impact illustrates shared value in action. While farmers gain direct market access for dependable income, buyers gain a diversified supplier base that provides better quality and freshness.\n",
      "In December 2016, the partners expanded the initiative to train an additional 5,000 farmers on best practices over the next two years, to help them increase incomes by 20 percent. The project aims to generate $18.7 million in sales, further growing an inclusive, sustainable produce market in Mexico.\n",
      "Tegemea Kalinga runs a small stand in her hometown of Mwampongo, Tanzania, where she sells fruits, rice and household goods. For nearly a decade, she has struggled with maintaining working capital to keep the business running. \n",
      "In 2016, Tegemea joined Business Women Connect (BWC), a TechnoServe project funded by the ExxonMobil Foundation that aims to increase the incomes of female micro-entrepreneurs through business skills training and access to mobile savings. “Saving can actually help you to manage your money so that you don’t need to go and borrow each time,” Tegemea said after learning to use M-Pawa, a mobile savings and loan product. She also received training on record-keeping, customer service and business planning, setting her shop on a path toward profitability. \n",
      "Around the world, women entrepreneurs face more challenges than their male counterparts in accessing networks, capital and knowledge, and they often face other cultural deterrents. TechnoServe is committed to providing women entrepreneurs like Tegemea with the tools they need to succeed, whether they are running microenterprises or developing small and growing businesses. In 2016, more than 6,380 women entrepreneurs and women-led businesses benefited financially from TechnoServe’s global entrepreneurship work.\n",
      "Some of our entrepreneurship programs, including BWC, are tailored specifically to meet the needs, constraints and opportunities of women – in this case, training approximately 6,000 Tanzanian women micro-entrepreneurs. BWC’s business counselors are all women entrepreneurs recruited from the local community. Seeing their success gives participant women confidence and motivation to set their own goals and apply new business practices they learn through BWC training.\n",
      "In order to test the program’s assumptions, BWC was designed to include a rigorous evaluation. The Center for Global Development, in collaboration with the World Bank’s Africa Gender Innovation Lab, is running a randomized control trial to measure the impact of both the introduction to mobile savings and the business training.\n",
      "Other TechnoServe interventions promote inclusive business growth by working with both male and female entrepreneurs in a gender-responsive manner. Impulsa Tu Empresa (ITE), a business accelerator program implemented by TechnoServe across Central America since 2012, has helped more than 600 women-led enterprises (or 57 percent of all beneficiaries) boost their revenues. In 2016, the program formally integrated gender equity training into its curriculum.\n",
      "TechnoServe teamed up with researchers from Emory University to analyze detailed data collected from hundreds of ITE-supported businesses. Among its insights, the report found that pairing women advisors with women entrepreneurs produced higher revenue growth than other mentor-mentee combinations.\n",
      "By collecting qualitative and quantitative data from our entrepreneurship programs around the world, TechnoServe can ensure that these interventions are effective in empowering women economically and driving gender equity.\n",
      "A nonprofit organization operating in 29 countries, TechnoServe is a leader in harnessing the power of the private sector to help people lift themselves out of poverty.\n",
      "By linking people to information, capital and markets, we have helped millions to create lasting prosperity for their families and communities. With nearly 50 years of proven results, TechnoServe believes in the power of private enterprise to transform lives.\n",
      "TechnoServe is overseen by a talented group of 27 leaders in finance, business, academia and law. Our board ensures that the organization faithfully pursues its mission and has the resources and direction it needs to be successful. \n",
      "TechnoServe is able to maximize its impact in poor communities thanks to the generous support of individual donors, who gave more than 18,700 gifts in 2016.\n",
      "TechnoServe’s staff of more than 1,420 combines business expertise with local knowledge, relationships and context; 91 percent are from the country where they work.\n",
      "The TechnoServe Fellows Program (formerly the Volunteer Consultant Program) celebrated 20 years in 2016 and deployed its 1,000th volunteer in 2016. A total of 64 Fellows worked on projects in 20 countries in 2016.\n"

      "MozaCajú has helped to catalyze the Mozambican cashew nut industry by harnessing global market demand for premium cashew and addressing obstacles throughout the value chain, such as production and processing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tMozambique is a beautiful country with extensive coasts along the Indian Ocean, lowlands that grow into highlands, and the impressive Eastern Great Rift Valley. Surrounded by such a dramatic landscape, you could be forgiven for not noticing the even more dynamic changes that Mozambique’s landscapes and livelihoods have experienced in recent years. In only four years, an additional 542,807 cashew tree seedlings have been planted, and more than 80,000 hectares of farmland are newly brimming with cashew trees and red-gold cashew apples.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tZooming in from the landscape to the household, the change is even more dramatic. Through the work of the MozaCajú project, which launched in 2014 and closes early this year, more than 23,000 farmers have been trained in the skills and practices they need to build more prosperous livelihoods from their cashew farms. In fact, the program, a collaboration between TechnoServe and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, has helped their yields to increase by an average of 53 percent, and their incomes by 66 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tOne key component to this vast change within the Mozambican cashew nut industry is taking place off the farm, in only a few buildings across the country: processing factories.\n",
      "\n",
      "By 2008, Mozambique had advanced from processing zero cashew nut to becoming the largest processor in Africa.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tOnce the world’s leading producer of cashew nut, Mozambique’s production sharply decreased as civil war, aging trees, and market obstacles inhibited growth. Raw nuts were exported to India and other nations for processing, taking much of the products’ added value potential with them. In 2002, TechnoServe began working within the country’s cashew industry, aiming to capture more of its value locally. By 2008, Mozambique had advanced from processing zero cashew nut to processing almost half of its production, making it one of the largest processors in Africa (and the fourth-largest processor in the world).\n",
      "\n",
      "\tWhen MozaCajú – “The Mozambican Cashew Project” – was launched, its aim was to accelerate this growth and impact by harnessing global market demand for premium cashew while addressing obstacles throughout the value chain such as production, inputs, processing, finance, and marketing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tWhile the project catalyzed impressive change at all levels of the value chain, processors were identified as a particularly crucial link. Without quality processing, even the increased yields wouldn’t help farmers tap into the market demand for high-quality cashew. Over four years, however, processors like Condor Nuts worked tirelessly alongside MozaCajú staff to transform their operations and make market connections with leading buyers such as Car Nut, a buyer for Costco.\n",
      "\n",
      "MozaCajú helped Condor to track the movements of product and personnel at every stage of production, an important part of safety, quality, and transparency.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tMany of the major transformations that Condor Nuts underwent through the program were realized through upgrades to its operations as the company improved its food safety management in an effort to become HACCP certified. This certification ensures buyers that appropriate controls are in place to decrease hazards and increase safety and quality throughout every step of production. Working with a food safety company, TechnoServe staff developed training guides and manuals for updating participating plants’ operations in order to replace low-efficiency, retroactive quality controls with processes that proactively identify and avoid food safety hazards.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tOnce Condor’s management was on board with the new procedures, MozaCajú technicians held training sessions with workers over several months, helping them to understand the risks of production as well as their roles in managing them. They even helped Condor to draft tailored registration sheets to track the movement of people and products within the factory (a crucial step towards traceability within the plant’s production), and to ensure the maintenance of their new policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tWith the new system in place, MozaCaju staff took a step back and let Condor take charge, only performing routine monitoring visits to ensure top-quality compliance. After their participation in the project, Condor became HACCP certified, paving the way to connections with new, more demanding buyers for their nuts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Market connections facilitated by MozaCajú have resulted in over 1,000 additional tons of cashew kernel sales for participating Mozambican processors.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tWhile some international buyers had previously sourced cashew from Mozambique, they had ultimately switched to other suppliers due to quality control issues. Having worked with processors like Condor to improve their quality standards, MozaCajú aimed to reforge these market linkages in an effort to create a broad market system in which Mozambique’s farmers and processors could thrive.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tIn 2015, MozaCajú contacted Caro Nut – a nut roaster and wholesaler that supplies cashew products to the major U.S. retailer Costco – and invited them to Mozambique to learn more about the Mozambican cashew industry. During their visit, MozaCajú introduced Caro Nut  to several Mozambican processors, and in 2016, Caro Nut placed its first order of cashew kernel from Condor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tMozaCajú helped to ensure the quality of these initial orders by checking on the containers – looking for variances between grades and conducting random nut counts – before they were shipped to Caro Nut’s roasting facility in Fresno, California. Since then, Caro Nut has ordered several containers of cashew per year from Condor and other other Mozambican processors, which now contribute to nearly half of Caro Nut’s total cashew sourced from Africa.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tIn total, market connections facilitated by MozaCajú have resulted in over 1,000 additional tons of cashew kernel sales for participating Mozambican processors.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a grant from MozaCajú, Condor bought Mozambique's first machine to extract raw cashew nut liquid, allowing them to utilize frequently discarded byproducts and diversify their production.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tOnce businesses like Condor are operating within stable processes and markets, they begin to have room to innovate and grow. In 2015, MozaCaju launched its matching grant fund, which provided funding for a variety of actors in the cashew supply chain, from processors, to farmers, to agro-dealers. The inspiration behind the grant was to give these enterprises access to equipment or technologies that would have otherwise been unavailable due to high cost or risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tCondor applied for the grant to purchase a Cashew Nut Shell Liquid extraction machine. Cashew shells are typically discarded or burned as an inefficient fuel after being removed during processing. However, the shell contains two useful byproducts – one is the extracted liquid, and the other the dried husk that remains.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tThanks to the grant, Condor was able to buy the first such extractor in Mozambique. They are already turning a profit from sale of the extracted liquid – which can be utilized in various industrial processes – and the dry shell can be burned as a cleaner, more efficient fuel. Condor is even piloting the sale of cooking stoves that are fueled by these “cashew shell cakes,” which they are providing to their employees on credit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tOverall, MozaCaju awarded 13 grants to 11 grantees, leveraging over $1 million in investments along the value chain.\n",

      "TechnoServe worked to improve the prosperity and sutainability of Guatemala's smallholder coffee production by teaching new farming techniques and encouraging women to take on more decision-making roles on the farm.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tAs many countries around the world settle into a cold winter, consumers turn to hot beverages for comfort. In fact, global coffee consumption is typically around 12 percent higher during these colder months for the global north – which is home to the majority of the world’s coffee-consuming heavyweights – when compared with summer months.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tHowever, while coffee consumers are cherishing their steaming cup of joe, many coffee producers across the globe are hard at work gathering their coffee harvest. In Guatemala the harvest season is at its peak, and approximately 120,000 smallholder farmers – those working less than 3 hectares of land – are collecting their crop.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tCoffee plays an important role in the household economies of these smallholders – who contribute to around 90 percent of the country’s total coffee production – making up nearly 60 percent of their earnings. But in recent years, that crucial income has come under threat as leaf rust, borer beetles, drought, and other challenges inhibit  production. Meanwhile, Guatemala’s coffee communities have often never had access to formal training and are ill-equipped to face these obstacles.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tThese communities often speak their local indigenous languages rather than Spanish, making standard resources methodologies difficult to implement. Traditionally they  have passed down their techniques through generations of family members and neighbors, but in the face of increasingly common barriers to production, their yields – and livelihoods – have suffered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Juan Carlos Cholotio began agronomic training with TechnoServe when the coffee borer beetle hurt his coffee yields. The program helped more than 15,000 farmers to increase their yields.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tJuan Carlos Cholotio knows this story all too well. He had been on a coffee farm for most of his life, first as a worker on a large coffee farm and then as the owner of his own small farm. But, in 2013, Juan Carlos noticed that his coffee cherries began to lose weight and, by extension, value. An infestation of the coffee borer beetle had struck his farm, and Carlos didn’t have the technical knowledge to save his farm.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tTechnoServe had been providing training to farmers like Carlos in Guatemala since 2011, helping them to adopt better farming practices and sustainably increase their yields. When Juan Carlos joined the program, he began working alongside the project’s agronomist and a local community trainer, who provided him with the information he needed to fight the coffee borer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tAs a busy provider for five children, Juan Carlos still made time for the monthly training sessions. “The method was great,” he remembers, “it was all very dynamic, didn’t take up much time, and each session was aligned with the crop’s cycle, so we could go straight to practice on our plots.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\tThis practical, in-the-field learning was an essential tenet of the program, which closed in 2016. In order to continue the community-level learning that characterized many of these isolated coffee communities, TechnoServe held all training sessions on a volunteer farmer’s land, which served as a demonstration plot. By holding all trainings locally, amongst neighbors, farmers could see and understand new best practices first hand, even if they were unable to read, write, or understand Spanish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elena Bizarro offered to use part of her coffee farm as a demonstration plot for community agronomic trainings. These plots help farmers to see the results of new techniques before applying them to their farms.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tOne of such demonstration plot owner is Elena Bizarro, a 57-year-old coffee farmer in Alotenango, Guatemala. Elena joined TechnoServe’s program when she began struggling to support herself from her coffee earnings. Her husband had passed away, her six children had moved to the city, and although she’d always helped her husband on the farm, she didn’t feel she she had the skills she needed to make it thrive.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tWhen project staff noticed her drive, they asked if she’d be willing to offer part of her farm as a demonstration plot for community trainings. “I felt so proud having people come and learn at my place,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tElena is an example of the plot’s effectiveness in introducing farmers to new practices. Even she was often nervous to implement new practices on the rest of her farm before first seeing the results on the plot, explaining, “After pruning, you could see the coffee revive, but I needed to see the full results before taking the risk with the other plants.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\tBut Elena is an inspiring example in other ways as well. Traditionally, women in Guatemala have limited participation in coffee production, as seen by Elena’s frequent support on the farm but minimal decision-making experience while her husband was alive. In order to support women’s more active roles in coffee farms and households, TechnoServe promoted female participation in the project, both as participants and demonstration plot leaders.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tIn total, women represented 57 percent of the total farmers trained in good agricultural practices through the project and 53 percent of demonstration plot owners. As one woman farmer put it, “After our husbands started seeing results, the relationship changed. Now they ask for our opinion, we talk about coffee. I think they see us differently.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Victor Quiñones, a community trainer working with TechnoServe, taught farmers new practices in practical, in-the-field training sessions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tThe example provided by these community leaders helped to turn theoretical lessons into concrete results for farmers. Through the project, 78 percent of farmers adopted better disease management practices, and 65 percent began improved pest management. Whereas before Juan Carlos had purchased and applied fertilizer sporadically whenever he had spare money, he now diligently prunes and fertilizes his coffee in the optimal growth stages and quantities to boost his yields. “Everything is relevant and has a purpose,” he explains. “You need to do it all and just at the right time if you want to see the results. I have the [coffee borer beetle] under control, and the cherries are coming in fat and heavy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\tArmed with the knowledge he needs to succeed and adapt in an increasingly challenging and dynamic coffee production system, the change on Juan Carlos’s farm is a vision not only of better yields for this season, but for the future. With his increased income he is saving to buy more plots, plant new coffee, and to continue to improve his farm and his livelihood.\n",

      "\n",
      "\tAs many countries around the world settle into a cold winter, consumers turn to hot beverages for comfort. In fact, global coffee consumption is typically around 12 percent higher during these colder months for the global north – which is home to the majority of the world’s coffee-consuming heavyweights – when compared with summer months.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tHowever, while coffee consumers are cherishing their steaming cup of joe, many coffee producers across the globe are hard at work gathering their coffee harvest. In Guatemala the harvest season is at its peak, and approximately 120,000 smallholder farmers – those working less than 3 hectares of land – are collecting their crop.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tCoffee plays an important role in the household economies of these smallholders – who contribute to around 90 percent of the country’s total coffee production – making up nearly 60 percent of their earnings. But in recent years, that crucial income has come under threat as leaf rust, borer beetles, drought, and other challenges inhibit  production. Meanwhile, Guatemala’s coffee communities have often never had access to formal training and are ill-equipped to face these obstacles.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tThese communities often speak their local indigenous languages rather than Spanish, making standard resources methodologies difficult to implement. Traditionally they  have passed down their techniques through generations of family members and neighbors, but in the face of increasingly common barriers to production, their yields – and livelihoods – have suffered.\n",

An infestation of the coffee borer beetle had struck his farm, and Carlos didn’t have the technical knowledge to save his farm.\n",

When Juan Carlos joined the program, he began working alongside the project’s agronomist and a local community trainer, who provided him with the information he needed to fight the coffee borer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tAs a busy provider for five children, Juan Carlos still made time for the monthly training sessions. “The method was great,” he remembers, “it was all very dynamic, didn’t take up much time, and each session was aligned with the crop’s cycle, so we could go straight to practice on our plots.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\tThis practical, in-the-field learning was an essential tenet of the program, which closed in 2016. In order to continue the community-level learning that characterized many of these isolated coffee communities, TechnoServe held all training sessions on a volunteer farmer’s land, which served as a demonstration plot. By holding all trainings locally, amongst neighbors, farmers could see and understand new best practices first hand, even if they were unable to read, write, or understand Spanish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elena Bizarro offered to use part of her coffee farm as a demonstration plot for community agronomic trainings. These plots help farmers to see the results of new techniques before applying them to their farms.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tOne of such demonstration plot owner is Elena Bizarro, a 57-year-old coffee farmer in Alotenango, Guatemala. Elena joined TechnoServe’s program when she began struggling to support herself from her coffee earnings. Her husband had passed away, her six children had moved to the city, and although she’d always helped her husband on the farm, she didn’t feel she she had the skills she needed to make it thrive.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tWhen project staff noticed her drive, they asked if she’d be willing to offer part of her farm as a demonstration plot for community trainings. “I felt so proud having people come and learn at my place,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tElena is an example of the plot’s effectiveness in introducing farmers to new practices. Even she was often nervous to implement new practices on the rest of her farm before first seeing the results on the plot, explaining, “After pruning, you could see the coffee revive, but I needed to see the full results before taking the risk with the other plants.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\tBut Elena is an inspiring example in other ways as well. Traditionally, women in Guatemala have limited participation in coffee production, as seen by Elena’s frequent support on the farm but minimal decision-making experience while her husband was alive. In order to support women’s more active roles in coffee farms and households, TechnoServe promoted female participation in the project, both as participants and demonstration plot leaders.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tIn total, women represented 57 percent of the total farmers trained in good agricultural practices through the project and 53 percent of demonstration plot owners. As one woman farmer put it, “After our husbands started seeing results, the relationship changed. Now they ask for our opinion, we talk about coffee. I think they see us differently.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Victor Quiñones, a community trainer working with TechnoServe, taught farmers new practices in practical, in-the-field training sessions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tThe example provided by these community leaders helped to turn theoretical lessons into concrete results for farmers. Through the project, 78 percent of farmers adopted better disease management practices, and 65 percent began improved pest management. Whereas before Juan Carlos had purchased and applied fertilizer sporadically whenever he had spare money, he now diligently prunes and fertilizes his coffee in the optimal growth stages and quantities to boost his yields. “Everything is relevant and has a purpose,” he explains. “You need to do it all and just at the right time if you want to see the results. I have the [coffee borer beetle] under control, and the cherries are coming in fat and heavy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\tArmed with the knowledge he needs to succeed and adapt in an increasingly challenging and dynamic coffee production system, the change on Juan Carlos’s farm is a vision not only of better yields for this season, but for the future. With his increased income he is saving to buy more plots, plant new coffee, and to continue to improve his farm and his livelihood.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tOver the course of the project TechnoServe trained 15,129 farmers, increasing their income by an average of 35 percent.\n",

      "In business, the management and development of information systems in organisations is often perceived as an information technology (IT) function led by technologically proficient personnel or IT managers. In as much as IT personnel are relevant, they are unfortunately not able to perform all relevant information systems management functions effectively. One major cause of this is that IT professionals are \"techies\" who have little understanding of the business the firm is engaged in and the core business objectives and/or strategies. As a result of this misalignment, some organisations acquire technology that fails to add value. This challenge of IT, is a global dilemma that is made worse by the complexity of IT and the lack of understanding of the full scope of IT management. \n",
      "This course is not an IT course and IT personnel will not have any \"unfair\" advantages. The focus of this module is to introduce a new perspective to the management of information technologies for businesses – the general manager's perspective – providing insights into general management questions such as: What do I need to know and do to ensure that IT is used effectively to drive the business?  For the IT manager, the course also provides insight into the scope and role of IT in the organisation to make them better managers of IT.\n",
      "This course seeks to provide a clear understanding of the dynamic social, political and economic environment of the firm.  A good knowledge of the relationship between government, business and society, trends in national strategy within the context of a changing international environment and their implications for the firm is imperative for the strategically minded general manager. It is designed to help managers understand the forces that shape those trends, adapt strategy as appropriate and identify a broad range of stakeholders in the environment of the firm with a view to enhancing the capacity for managing relationships with these stakeholders.\n",

You will gain a deep understanding of the key issues, trends and challenges associated with managing people in organisations, in five key areas: resourcing and talent management, performance management, reward management, human capital development, and employee relations. The HRM course builds on two foundational core courses: Human Behaviour in Organisations I and II, and enlists the disciplines of economics, social psychology, and sociology. \n",
      "The purpose of the course is to enable the individual identify the numerous opportunities and imperatives for negotiation and to assist the individual and the organization in turning negotiation into a winning corporate capability. In today's world, research evidence has shown that every person (Legal and human) exists in a complex web of relationships formed, one at a time, through NEGOTIATION. As more relationships become necessary, and are entered into, they are preceded by and arise out of further negotiations. Purchasing and sales agreements are negotiated with vendors, marketing arrangements are negotiated with Agencies and third parties. Wages, salaries and employment terms are negotiated with unions or individual employees. Conflict situations are settled through negotiations and assisted negotiations. Taken together the thousands of negotiations an organization engages in have an enormous effect on both its strategy and its bottom line.\n",
      "This module is designed to help participants to set themselves realistic goals for both their professional and personal life(s), based on the right values and on their strengths, taking account of their weaknesses but also of the resources available for them to move forward towards ambitious goals.

The teaching methods used include a case study, tools for self-assessment, feedback from classmates, tools for feedback from others, and working sessions.\n",
      "The Final Year Business Plan is a compulsory aspect of the MEMBA programme aimed at enhancing the participant's academic and professional development.

Participants work in groups under supervision by a faculty member to prepare a business plan for a business of their choice. This process enables each participant to put into practice the knowledge acquired during the first and second years of the programme in developing a viable business plan. Though participants work in groups, emphasis is placed on individual contributions within the group in order to ensure appropriate learning is accomplished.\n",
      "​The MEMBA Programme is enriched with varieties of learning methods, networking activities and empirical projects that yield effective results during and on completion of the programme; it expands the horizon, perspectives of both intra-preneurs and entrepreneurs. Embedded in this enriched programme is a compulsory trip abroad. Participants in various programs from Lagos Business School have been participating in several trips abroad, more so is a red tape experience for the pioneer Modular Executive MBA (MEMBA) set, who flew to one of world's most admirable city state – Singapore in partnership with Nanyang Technology University for a one-week abroad study trip and networking sessions with Singaporean Executive Professionals and Business men. The week study trip is a compulsory aspect of the programme that exposes the participants to other country's business and corporate culture. Evident is the benefit to organizations that may desire to expand their businesses globally; and for executives to have wider networks.\n"

      "Lagos Business School (LBS) has become the first institution in West Africa to be accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB).  With effect from December 1, 2016, LBS joins the league of less than 5% of business schools globally, to be accredited by this body.\n",
      "AACSB is the leading global accreditation body for business schools offering undergraduate, masters and doctorate degrees in business and accounting. Founded in 1916, AACSB has its headquarters at Tampa, Florida, United States of America, it is the largest business education network, linking students, academia and businesses to advance the cause of business education around the world.\n",
      "By the feat of AACSB Accreditation, Lagos Business School has once more distinguished itself as a management education provider of high repute in Africa. Only four other schools in the entire continent have this accreditation; three in South Africa and one in Egypt.\n",
      "The accreditation process is designed to validate business schools that are committed to global standards of excellence in strategic management and innovation, student experience, and quality of both teaching and non-teaching staff. This accreditation affirms Lagos Business School's undeniable commitment, over the last 25 years, to world-class standards in teaching, learning, research, academic and professional management. The rigorous accreditation process of AACSB International and the LBS' ability to scale all the hurdles by sheer determination and strong leadership, have more than ever confirmed LBS' status as one of the most distinguished business schools in Africa.\n",
      "In his congratulatory message, the Vice President and Chief Accreditation Officer of the global accrediting body, Robert D. Reid said:\n",
      "\"Congratulations Lagos Business School and Dean Enase Okonedo on being the first institution in Nigeria to earn accreditation, and we welcome them into the family of AACSB-accredited business schools. AACSB Accreditation represents the highest achievement for an educational institution that awards business degrees. The entire Lagos (LBS) team - including the administration, faculty, directors, staff, and students - are to be commended for their roles in earning accreditation.\"\n",
      "The AACSB International accreditation, among other benefits, accords students of accredited schools the opportunity to participate in international student exchange programmes with other accredited schools. It also increases students' competitiveness in the domestic and international labour markets, helping them get recognised worldwide by top employers and other universities.\n",
      "In addition, the accreditation provides faculty members of these business schools with opportunities for in-depth research and global recognition. Faculty and staff of accredited schools are assured of the school's visibility and increased capacity to attract top quality students for their programmes. Alumni of accredited schools can be proud of their alma maters' global visibility and recognition – a validation of the quality of their certificates.\n",
      "LBS has earned this global accreditation mainly because of its commitment to the core values of professionalism and ethics and in passionately pursuing its objectives of:\n",
      "·         Providing high potential professionals with a general management education which stresses professional ethics and service to the community through the practice of management\n",
      "·         Making a positive impact on the professional and ethical standards of business management in Nigeria\n",
      "·         Making intellectual contributions which: (a) support the practice of management; (b) contribute to the advancement of the management disciplines; and (c) create high quality teaching materials.\n"

      "The founders of Lagos Business School were inspired by the teachings of Saint Josemaría Escrivá, founder of the Catholic institution, Opus Dei. The Prelature of Opus Dei encourages Christians of all social classes to live consistently with their faith, in the middle of the ordinary circumstances of their lives, especially through the sanctification of their professional work and family life. It encourages them to also play an active role in the just and efficient ordering of their societies. \n",
      "The Prelature of Opus Dei takes responsibility for guaranteeing that all teaching, publishing and research activities in LBS are based on the Christian vision of man, society and economic activity. This ensures that even LBS reminds people to respect and serve the dignity of the human person while carrying out business activities.\n",

It currently has over 90,000 members made up of men and women of every kind of occupation and social status. The majority of its members are lay people living secular lives. A small minority are secular priests. Opus Dei members do not include religious men or women (i.e. monks and nuns).\n",

A few years later, he initiated Opus Dei and subsequently dedicated the rest of his life to the task of governing and directing its growth. He held a doctorate degree in civil law and a doctorate degree in theology. He is the author of several publications aimed at assisting his spiritual children grow in prayer and communion with God. The best known of these is The Way which has been translated into numerous languages and has sold several million copies. He died in Rome 26 June 1975. He was declared a saint by St Pope John Paul II in 2002.\n",

Thus CIPRA seeks to advance the need to approach infrastructural provision, policy formulation and regulation in a more structured and strategic manner to ensure not only sustained availability of infrastructure, but also ensuring that public and private sector investment in this area is facilitated by a public policy and regulatory environment that is progressive and renders private investors enthusiastic about investing. \n",

      "Keynote Address delivered by Dr Doyin Salami for the Africa Public Service Day. Doyin Salami, a renowned economist, is Faculty at the Lagos Business School and a member of the Central Bank of Nigeria's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC).\n",
      "The Nigerian Civil Service has its roots in the colonial public service institutions that existed in the territories that later came to be known as Nigeria, from the earlier Colony of Lagos to the Northern and Southern Protectorates. The amalgamation of these vast swathes of territory, first of the Colony of Lagos into the Southern Protectorate in 1906, and the subsequent unification of the two protectorates of the North and South led to the formation of the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria.\n",
      "Driven basically by the colonial rationale of setting up administrative convenience for its activities, it has been generally observed across much of the scholarship on early public administration that the British, rather, unfortunately, imposed a unified civil service structure on the vastly nuanced territories of the Northern and Southern protectorates of Nigeria, with scant regard for local acceptability or durability. And this was equally without much consideration for the idiosyncrasies and differences across the fairly complex customary systems, values and authority structures of traditional societies.\n",
      "As a formal organisation with a transformed notion of identity, the Nigerian Civil Service could be said to have come into existence around 1954, as a culmination of efforts geared towards the redefinition of the purpose of the Service, in line with the need to deliver public service to and cater to the welfare of Nigerians.\n",
      "Crucial to the demands for a shift in the delivery orientation was the advent of the Nigerianisation policy, seeking to make the Civil Service more responsive to serving the interests and needs of Nigerians in a primary and wholesome manner. The service was located at the core of the Nigerianisation policy, \"Nigerianisation of the Civil Service implying the reduction and ultimately the ending of expatriate predominance in the higher levels of the Civil Service\" (Skewat, 2002).\n",
      "In that period, the process of repurposing the Service was geared towards making it an institution vital to policy formulation and implementation, with the objective of improving the lot and ultimately creating life-enhancing benefits for the generality of the Nigerian people. It was strongly considered a vehicle for driving development and having the Nigerian at the centre of its operations, to enable social and economic progress, and the growth of infrastructure that caters to the needs of the people of the country.\n",
      "Providing for the Nigerian citizen and ensuring his or her welfare is certainly the fundamental purpose of government and this is a responsibility it bears across all its levels, tiers, organs, institutions, agencies and departments. This obligation to citizens is, more so, primarily enshrined in the document articulating the basis of our social compact as a nation – the Nigerian Constitution, in its past and present renditions.\n",
      "It is an essence brought into clear focus in Section 14 2(b) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999, where it is proclaimed that \"the security and welfare of the people shall be the primary purpose of government.\" This notion of \"welfare\" referred to in the body of legislation situates the Nigerian as the Maison d'être of government, which actions must be fundamentally directed towards the promotion of the well-being of the citizen, upon whom its legitimacy rests.\n",
      "Against this backdrop, it is crucial to note that beyond the political leadership, the civil service – as the engine room of government in its different iterations – is the institution with the most significant and direct impact on the life of the Nigerian citizen, and the promotion of his or her welfare, or lack thereof. It is the institution vested with the primary responsibility for implementing and coordinating the actions and activities of government, in a manner that bears consequence to the Nigerian.\n",
      "As a corollary to the foregoing, it is important to emphasise that the essence of public service delivery is entailing the creation of the basis for citizens' experience of the fruits of governance, in a way that should gratify needs and have a positive impact on individuals, in addition to enhancing their well-being.\n",
      "The more positive outcomes individuals experience as a result of public service delivery, the more trust and respect they would repose in the provider. Hence, there is a strong interconnectedness between service delivery, the institutions mandated to execute this (in this case, the Nigerian Civil Service) and the legitimacy consequently conferred on governments by citizens.\n",
      "From the foregoing, a question that logically arises is: Does the Civil Service actually know the target of its service delivery – the Nigerian?\n",
      "A set of secondary concerns are raised in unpacking this salient question, including whether the Civil Service fully understands the expectations of citizens in terms of service delivery; has adequate data to profile their needs, and the comprehensive framework to cater for the welfare and deliver benefits to them?\n",
      "Understanding the Nigerian, his/her needs and expectations where public service and dimensioning these along the lines of the various socio-economic and socio-cultural categories into which Nigerians fall is critical to untangling the immense challenges of service delivery in Nigeria, and activating the \"customer-centric\" approach earlier mentioned.\n",
      "It is easy to yield to the convenient impulse to point out other assailants of good governance and government, including the failure of political leadership and corruption, etc., as largely responsible for the derailment of national plans and efforts to improve quality of life in areas such as healthcare, education, etc. Nevertheless, such failures offer a perspective to reflect on the deficits of service delivery in Nigeria.\n",
      "In spite of decades of planning, recognised indices of human development do not suggest any positive or sustained sense of progress. This is starkly revealed in the trajectory of the poverty incidence in the country, which when juxtaposed with population growth and demographic shifts reveal the contours of the dire nature of our circumstance.\n",
      "What could be considered as the expectations of Nigerians from government, governance and service delivery? Incidentally, these expectations are fairly well framed in no other document than the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999. In Chapter 2 of the Constitution, entitled \"The Fundamental Objectives and Directive Principles of State Policy\", it is not only stated that \"the security and welfare of the people shall be the primary purpose of government\", but it is claimed that;\n",
      "16. (1) The State shall, within the context of the ideals and objectives for which provisions are made in this Constitution:(a) harness the resources of the nation and promote national prosperity and an efficient, a dynamic and self-reliant economy;(b) control the national economy in such manner as to secure the maximum welfare, freedom and happiness of every citizen on the basis of social justice and equality of status and opportunity; Also, it is further stated;\n",
      "16.2 (d) that suitable and adequate shelter, suitable and adequate food, reasonable national minimum living wage, old age care and pensions, and unemployment, sick benefits and welfare of the disabled are provided for all citizens.\n",
      "As such, it can be said that in line with the expressed provisions of the Constitution, the government is tasked with the mandate of creating an environment that is vital to securing the welfare of the people. \n",
      "The youth are, undoubtedly, the most valuable resource of a country – and a continent, the foundation on which the future stands, and the means for delivering on the prospects and potentials of the human experience. In Nigeria, they constitute both a huge source of hope and anxiety, in terms of what they represent for the national fortune and the gross inadequacy of the planning presently being made on their behalf.\n",
      "Over 60 percent of the Nigerian youth populations live in rural areas, whilst the other 40 percent live in urban and peri-urban locations. Whereas over 65 percent of the Nigerian youth is said to have some form of formal education, with 55 percent of this demographic subset being female and the others being male, so many youths are plagued by serious deficits of skills and capacity, making them highly susceptible to unemployment, underemployment, and economic exploitation. Equally, a host of them with certain levels of capability have been sucked deep into the informal sector, particularly in low-income engagements and activities, where their exertions are not commensurate with the value being produced. Hemmed in by the combination of deprivation and lack of meaningful opportunity, many are vulnerable to crimes and different forms of delinquency.\n",
      "The plethora of issues affecting the Nigerian youth, while evolving from a base of material inadequacy and deprivation, can be seen to generally include low levels of educational attainment and consequently prospective lack of fitness for future challenges, the breakdown of social value systems leading them along less-than-desirable orientations and deviant behaviour, a nationally pervasive culture of indiscipline and the dearth of life mentoring opportunities. Concerns issuing from the foregoing have equally opened the youth up to the susceptibilities of religious fanaticism, cultism, crime and other socially reprehensible conduct.\n",
      "The Nigerian Youth Policy situates it's very important to target demographic, their needs and aspirations, at the centre of national development and planning, while seeking to understand and proffer solutions to their issues and challenges in the process. It strives for youth development in the country to not only be youth-led and driven but for youth issues to be integrated into all the sectors of national life, in a manner that would guarantee holistic development.\n",
      "As a declaration of the priorities and directions of government in relation to the youth, the National Youth Policy attempts the coordination of all the other policies dealing with the youth, both indigenous – including the National Policy on Population for Sustainable Development, the National Health Policy, and the National Policy on Education, etc. – and the ones domesticated from international instruments. \n",
      " The National Youth Policy does not consider the youth as an amorphous category, but endeavours to direct development planning in a manner that is sensitive to the nuances of gender, religion, tradition and culture. Whether in terms of youths needing liberation from the yokes of gender discrimination, religious radicalisation or armed conflict and restiveness, the National Youth Policy provides the frame for targeting these demographic sub-categories for intervention differently and more proactively.\n",
      "As in much of the developing parts of the world, Africa is home to surges in population growth, occurring rather disproportionately to the manners of planning being made for them, and henceforth putting the resources of states under tremendous pressure. This has in part spawned the inevitable fallout of the routine rehearsals and outbreak of conflicts that have largely come to signpost the identity of the continent.\n",
      "Vital to the issue of coordinating the potentials of the African youth has been the context of a resurgent Africa, as framed within the latest 50-year grand vision to break the continent from a cycle of want and make its development essentially driven by its people, and articulated by the African Union (AU) in the declaration known as Agenda 2063.\n",
      "This immense regional agenda was formulated in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Organisation of African Unity, which has transfigured into the African Union (AU), towards achieving the \"Africa that we want\". It is conceived of as \"an integrated, prosperous and peaceful Africa, driven by its own citizens and representing a dynamic force in the international arena\".\n",
      "As equally outlined by the African Union, there are four interconnected pillars for delivering on the youth demographic dividend, particularly in view of the First Ten-Year Implementation Plan towards achieving the African Renaissance encapsulated in Agenda 2063. These include a first pillar of creating opportunities for employment and entrepreneurship, aimed at reducing at least a quarter of the number of unemployed youths on the continent by 2024; improving access to credit for businesses and establishing sub-regional Youth Funds; engaging the private sector for the expansion of internships, alongside CSR initiatives from African philanthropists; and promoting programmes for African youth volunteers and junior professionals, etc.\n",
      "A second pillar pertains to the enabling of massive investment in education and skills development, comprising the review of educational curricula to \"increase quality and relevance to the labour market and national developmental needs\", with emphasis on skills development and STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) Education. This is to equally include the expansion of vocational training opportunities, promotion of inclusive access to education at all levels, the adoption of lifetime approaches to learning and establishment of regional educational institutions that create learning and exchange opportunities, etc.\n",
      "The third interconnected pillar for the empowerment of the African youth to produce the demographic dividend speaks to the need to invest in health and wellbeing. This involves the institution of integrated adolescent and youth friendly health services, the prioritisation of universal access to family planning services, and the necessity of improving the nutrition of children. Moreover, it would require the enhancement of maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health, and the scaling up of policies to support the reproductive rights of women, etc.\n",
      "The fourth pillar dealing with rights, governance and youth empowerment, is about ensuring the ratification, domestication and comprehensive implementation of the African Union's Shared Values instruments, such as the African Youth Charter and the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance (ACDEG), by all African countries by the end of 2017. Also, it entails the creation of national implementation mechanisms, the elimination of all barriers to the participation of the youth in the political space, and the abolition of policies, practices and customs that have discriminatory effects on the youth, especially girls and young women, etc.\n",
      "The foregoing constitute the regional framework for activating the demographic dividends that would set Africa on the part of a virile future, which is expected to be domesticated and serve as the basis of national action plans, from which programmes would be designed.\n",
      "The Nigerian Civil Service has witnessed a transformation from an institution basically serving the interests of the British Empire and its economic logic of exploiting its colonial outposts, to one that has made progressive evolution in the reform of its mandate. It has grown in strength and capacity as the engine room for government and governance in Nigeria. And this is despite its myriad challenges. Even then, there is still so much the institution can transform into as it works to fortify its ability to deliver on public services that would enhance the welfare of the Nigerian.\n",
      "From the policy of Nigerianisation to the host of reform efforts targeted at the Civil Service, the focus had been the repurposing of a delivery culture that has the Nigerian as the ultimate beneficiary of the activities of governance. Whilst the ills of poor political leadership and pervasive corruption could be said to exert deep levels of distortion on the capability of the Civil Service to realise its mandate, it still needs to draw insights from modern 'customer-centric' perspectives to transform its public service delivery obligation into one that is more citizen-centred. This entails understanding its 'customer' in more than cursory ways and building the capacity to targets his or her needs effectively.\n",
      "As the largest and fastest growing population on the continent, any programme of youth development in the country is undeniably regional in impact and consequence. Considered as the key catalyst for implementing the mandate of governance, the Civil Service is crucial to making the delivery of the demographic dividend a reality as its sprawling and country-wide bureaucracy is the principal vehicle for giving life to the agenda of the government. Yet, on a primary level, with respect to Service Delivery to Nigerian youths, there is the need to build a thorough and continually evolving understanding of who they are whilst, as the 'deep government', facilitating their effective participation in national development.\n",
      "The Civil Service needs to endeavour more in promoting a comprehensive, multisectoral approach to youth issues and concerns in the country. And consequently ensure the mainstreaming of the youth, as an essential development category, into the respective agenda of all government agencies.\n",
      "There is the compelling need to be more inclusive and sensitive to all the nuances of the Nigerian youth as a particular focus of its policies and programmes, whether in terms of differences across cultural contexts, gender, location (the rural/urban divide), physical states of being (disabilities), etc.\n",
      "As observed in the foregoing, crucial to the concerns about a citizen-centred service delivery culture in Nigeria, at the institutional level, are not only the challenges to professionalism, but also the questions of pervasive corruption, and the lack of political will to carry through reforms in the Civil Service.\n",
      "Since one of the abiding – if equally crucial – issues eroding the capacity to deliver on public services has always been financing, the tide of the haemorrhage of government resources has to be stemmed decisively through the tackling of the question of a ghost labour force. One can then imagine how much funds would be saved when the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS) is achieved on a single platform.\n",
      "To tame the monster of corruption, vital to the reform of public procurement in Nigeria, and the return of the Federal Executive Council to its core policy making function (away from the distraction of serving as a procurement ratifying body in a number of past years), is the imperative of inaugurating the National Council for Public Procurement (NCPP), as created by the Procurement Act of 2007.\n",
      "Essential to entrenching a citizen-centred service delivery culture is the augmentation of government finances for the Civil Service to be able to deliver on the programmes required for a youth-led future that has great implications for the African continent. A key way of achieving this is through the bolstering of the revenue base of the Nigerian state, by means of an enhancement of the taxation system, the securing of total tax compliance by private and public individuals – including officials, the restructuring of corporate tax waivers, and enforcement of tax laws through the judicial system.\n",
      "If the many issues and concerns that have been highlighted and reiterated are well considered, comprehensively engaged and tackled, both at the institutional level and that of the political leadership that motivates its processes, I have no doubt that the Nigerian Civil Service is still uniquely positioned to deliver on and deepen a culture of public service delivery that would positively unfetter the full potentials of a youth-led and driven future.\n",
      "Are you one of those people who automatically get a few sleepless nights at the notification of an upcoming major presentation? For some of us, even after we call its bluff and somewhat go ahead to perform satisfactorily, we still get nervous again at the next call. Nervousness seems like an enigma of sorts, doesn't it? Well, it is worthy of mention here that getting nervous is not peculiar to you or to a certain class of persons. Some of the greatest orators to grace this earth have been nervous before key speeches. You are definitely not alone in this. Perhaps you should be doubly assured after reading this point from the University of Pittsburgh:\n",
      "\"Experiencing speech anxiety is normal. Nearly everyone gets nervous when they have to give a speech or a presentation, even experienced speakers. The speakers that look relaxed and confident have simply learned how to handle their anxiety and use it to enhance their performance.\" **\n",
      "There are many reasons why people have their nerves rattled before and during presentations. The fearful reaction begins in the human brain. The threat of things going awry during a presentation triggers the fight or flight response in the part of the human brain responsible for the perception of the fear emotion called the Amygdala. This aligns with the natural human instinctive reaction to 'life threatening' situations. The reasons for fear are not far-fetched. It could be fear of rejection, fear of mistakes, or fear of failure. According to Randall P. Whatley, fear may emanate from your thoughts, echoing your inability to communicate effectively. You may think that your message is not important or you may not know the correct way to phrase your thoughts. You may even worry that your audience is likely to disagree with you or some people in there would dislike your personality. Fear may also come from your perceived inability to persuade, therefore the increased likelihood of rejection and disappointment.\n",
      "The next time you get on stage and notice your palms sweaty and all watery, do not think of running to the doctor after the speech, your body was just responding to the uneasiness that you had put it in. Apart from sweaty palms, the following are some of the common signs of nervousness:\n",
      "As noted earlier, great speakers do not cave into their fears, they confront and turn them into a passion that lights up the stage from the moment they get on it. The following are key recommended steps to help you build confidence, conquer your fear and deliver your message convincingly:\n",
      "1.  Prepare and Practice Adequately. Exhaustive preparation erodes to a great extent the fear of mistakes and failure. It is a proven confidence-builder. Some antagonistic members of the audience would beat a quick retreat when they perceive that you 'know your stuff.' So rather than seek to get you to prove yourself, they would seek to collaborate. This would give your confidence an extra boost. Thorough preparation and practice will also decrease the level of your anxiety. You sure should not ignore these.\n",
      "2.  Take Charge of Your Mind. Your mind and body should be under your total control, especially few moments to your presentation. If you allow your thoughts to stray into the terrain of negativity, your fear level goes up. So, strive to be in control of your thoughts and allow only positive thoughts to hold sway. Visualise yourself making a great success of the opportunity and go for it. Accept that it is normal to be nervous and so convert that reality to a strong connection with your audience. Remember that you are speaking to humans and not celestial beings. Most members of your audience appreciate the fact that you can make mistakes and will appreciate it when you do not attempt to be artificial. Relax.\n",
      "3.  Exercise and Control Your Breathing. Experts have documented the benefits of exercises to self-confidence and well-being; give some time to it. According to Bonnie Gross, President of Speech Science, the shaky voice during the presentation is the result of irregular breathing, so pay attention to the way you breathe. The recommended pattern is to breathe out when your words are coming out and breathe in when you pause. \n",
      "4.  Stay Hydrated. Gulp some water to keep you hydrated and prevent your mouth from getting dry to the extent that your speech is impaired. Let the words flow with ease.\n",
      "5.  Have Your Back-up Plans. Especially when you are using technology as a major enabler of your presentation, get back-ups handy. If your PowerPoint document corrupts and fails to open or your external drive falls off your pocket on your way to the venue, what would be the next step to take? How about the failure of the public address system and other equipment? These system failures can be unsettling and cause you to look down on yourself, so make plans in advance to positively respond to unforeseen circumstances.\n",
      "The heavy torrential downpours of the past nine days have succeeded in exposing the poverty of urban planning or lack of it in the Lekki peninsula and also teaching Lagos an important lesson. Appropriate development planning has never been an uncoordinated, knee-jerk, and ad-hoc affair. It has always been coordinated, comprehensive, integral and robust. When you cut through a town with elevated highways without simultaneously rechanneling the drainage system, you make the kind of embarrassing flooding that has swept through large parts of the Lagoon peninsula inevitable.\n",
      "The truth is that certain elements are entirely missing in our infrastructural and urban development planning. There is just no way to downplay the importance of flood plain analysis in estate development and not reap disaster when the floods come. Flooding in our tropical environment and especially along coastal planes like Lagos is unavoidable and therefore not surprising in any way. Every city experiencing heavy downpour will certainly have some areas submerged underwater as the rains gather in intensity and duration, but what determines the extent of damage is the availability of appropriate and adequate provision for surface water runoff after such heavy downpour.  Without the provision of unobstructed channels to convey flood water to either artificial or natural receptacles such as canals, lakes or even the nearby sea as in the case of Lagos, then we have provided just a recipe for disaster.   \n",
      "Of note is the increasing speed with which the nearby Lagoon that normally serves as a natural receptacle for surface water in the Lagos Island is been reclaimed for real estate purposes.   There has to be due consideration of the natural surface water cycle.  Nobody seems to care what happens to runoff systems coming from the built-up areas. It is also possible that natural water flow paths have been blocked or altered by these developments.   \n",
      "Every part of Lagos - not just the Island - must be sufficiently drained and linked to existing canals and all canals must open up to the lagoons and these lagoons must be dredged regularly. But it seems that this falls on deaf ears to all and sundry, including government developers.  Private estate developers in the Lagos Island seem to abide by no known rules except to fleece unsuspecting Lagosians of their funds in the guise of selling what in fact, are no better than poorly planned neighborhoods that parallels pro-poor council apartments in the UK and elsewhere in the world. They build estates while neglecting the flow system that interacts with the outside environment. The consequence is most certainly the improperly directed effluent flows that create the kind of floods we have witnessed in the past few days.  Yet I do not see this trend dissipating anytime soon as both estate developers and government seem to collude in this environmental wreckage. \n",
      "Another point to note is that the poorly constructed roads have all but given way under the unrelenting onslaught of the heavy downpours. Pot holes have quickly emerged even on roads and bridges that were very recently commissioned. You can't but begin to wonder if the engineers never factored-in obvious ecological conditions in their models and materials selection. If we add that it costs significantly higher to construct a kilometer of road in Nigeria than anywhere else in the world, you begin to understand the sort of sleight-of-hand on display in these things.   The question that challenges people like us is just how could a professional supervisor approve such shoddy work?   It is clear that substandard materials were employed or if not, consideration was not given to the prevailing ecological conditions in materials selection and handling.\n",
      "My take is that public private partnerships (PPP) remain the most effective mechanism to procure infrastructural services in a system such as ours. By transferring risks to private sector, the later are incentivized to install efficient solutions and in moments like this, there's a clear culprit to blame. While we are happy that the Lagos State government has responded to some areas, I believe that a sustainable plan would be to create a robust planning system that leverages modern simulation technologies to address the longer-term solutions to these challenges. If Lagos, known to have a reserve of more competent and professional bureaucracy – better than even the federal government – can suffer these ugly situations, one wonders what would be the case in other states of the federation that are much less endowed. Yet, I strongly recommend PPPs for infrastructure service provision in our peculiar system.\n",
      "LBS: Dr Oghenovo Obrimah, congratulations on being recognised as a top 10% author on the reputable Social Science Research Network. (https://hq.ssrn.com/rankings/Ranking_display.cfm?RequestTimeout=5000&TRN_gID=7&TMY_gID=2&dgcid=top-newauthorsmay).  It must be nice to be ranked alongside Nobel Prize winners like Professor Eugene Fama.\n",
      "Dr Obrimah: Thank You. It always feels good to be recognised for one's output and productivity particularly when the recognising agent has reputation, as is the case with SSRN, which now is associated with what arguably, is the most reputable brand in academic what arguably is the most reputable brand in academic publishing-Elsevier               \n",
      "LBS: Dr Obrimah, you just presented a paper at a conference (https://www.stevens.edu/events/emerging-trends-entrepreneurial-finance) with focus on entrepreneurial financing, particularly, angel financing, crowdfunding, and venture capital. What exactly do these terms, angel financing, crowdfunding, and venture capital mean?\n",
      "Dr Obrimah: Venture capitalists - investors who provide venture capital financing - operate within the context of legal entities called venture capital funds. They raise capital from investors to invest in high risk, high growth ventures whose business ideas are robust enough to enable these ventures to become publicly quoted companies. Since they raise funds from investors, they are financial intermediaries - agents or firms that connect suppliers and demanders of capital.\n",
      "Angel investors - investors who provide angel financing - are sophisticated individual investors who seek out promising projects that are not promising enough for venture capitalists. These ventures typically have secured a patent already, or have a product that is ready for patenting.  While these investors invest their own money, they increasingly are operating within the context of well-defined groupings, as such increasingly are functioning like a consortium of individual investors inclusive of a gatekeeper who may not invest any money of his or her own but acts as a financial intermediary.\n",
      "Crowdfunders - individuals who provide financing within context of crowdfunding platforms - are a potpourri of sophisticated or relatively non-sophisticated investors seeking investment opportunities.  Crowdfunding that involves the provision of financing in exchange for debt or equity certificates is the most credible form of crowdfunding and is the sort studied by academics. Firms seeking crowdfunding list on a crowdfunding platform (e.g. Indiegogo, Kickstarter, Crowdfunder) and attempt to convince crowdfunders to invest in their business model.\n",
      "LBS: Dr Obrimah, thinking about your descriptions of the three different classes of investors, it seems difficult to disentangle ventures that attract one form of financing from the others. What are the distinctive differences between ventures that attract venture capital vis-a-vis angel financing, vis-a-vis crowdfunding?\n",
      "Dr Obrimah: The most important distinction is the anticipated growth rate of the company. If the business model cannot be grown so fast the company delivers a good return within a few years, a good company with a good business model may not be able to attract venture capital financing. The company, however, may be able to attract either of angel financing or crowdfunding.  If the company does not have a unique product, it may not be able to attract angel financing, but may be able to attract crowdfunding.\n",
      "Dr Obrimah:  In my paper, I develop a theoretical model that predicts which types of entrepreneurs should approach which types of venture capitalists for financing. Since financing terms are functions of project quality as opposed to functions of the person of entrepreneurs, the paper predicts which types of projects should be funded by which types of venture capitalists. Interestingly, it appears the prediction holds not only for venture capital but for angel financing and crowdfunding as well. \n",
      "In terms of details, the paper predicts the riskiest high growth projects should be funded by venture capitalists that have the highest ability. This prediction actually runs counter to the prevailing wisdom in stock markets. In stock markets, the highest ability underwriters are predicted to underwrite the least risky issues of equity.  This has been shown to be true. As you can see then, arriving at the opposite prediction in venture capital runs contrary to the conventional wisdom, but is consistent with predictions in one of my other papers (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconbus.2016.05.003).\n",
      "Dr Obrimah: I have always studied entrepreneurial financing from the financiers' perspective. It was interesting to find other researchers studying entrepreneurial finance from the entrepreneurs' perspective arriving at conclusions that in principle do not contradict knowledge generated from the study of financiers, such as venture capitalists. \n",
      "Dr Obrimah: If Africa does not get its act together, the distance between Africa and developed countries will continue to grow. Crowdfunding has emerged in part as one avenue for non-sophisticated investors to generate higher returns than they can obtain from savings accounts or bank deposits.  Neither of angel financing nor venture capital, which has been shown to be very good for facilitation of economic development are well developed in Nigeria or Africa. While these sources of financing remain largely undeveloped in Africa, they are becoming increasingly more sophisticated in developed countries. Frankly, Nigeria and Africa are increasingly being left behind. There is a need to address and attempt to redress this developmental gap. \n",
      "Dr Obrimah: Thank you for the opportunity to engage the LBS community and visitors to our online sites in this discussion.\n",
      "An interview with Uche Attoh, LBS Faculty and Human Resource Specialist on how to keep employees motivated in a recession.​​\n",
      "The word motivation derives from a Latin word \"moverim\" meaning to move. What it generally means is how you move.  In business terms motivation relates to three areas: attitude to work; behavior, which is a manifestation of the attitude; and the output which is produced.\n",
      "Therefore, when we say motivation, it means the internal or external factors that will predispose an individual or employee to move in a particular direction that will lead to a positive change in attitude, behaviour and output.  \n",
      "UA: Generally, as a leader in any organisation, we need to look at the attitude, behaviour and output of employees. What is the attitude you perceive?  What is the manifestation of behaviour?  What are they producing?  When you begin to see negative tendencies in all these, it tells you immediately that people are not motivated. \n",
      "UA: There are several theories of motivation such as the Maslow hierarchy of needs. For years, managers have adopted this theory of motivation, but recent studies by Harvard Business Review has seen that some of these classical theories are culture bound and they relate to the culture in which those theories were developed. In other words, what motivates a European may not necessarily apply to an African, which is why classical motivational theories failed in many parts of the world.\n",
      "On the other hand, there are universal theories and factors, which come to play when thinking about employee motivation most especially in a recession. Organisations must ensure that certain factors and fundamentals are in place in order to ensure employee motivation. These factors include the following:- \n",
      "1. Organisational Justice: This is an important area that may predispose individuals to motivation. The extent at which employees perceive a high level of organisational justice determines how much employees will be motivated.  There are three dimensions of organisational justice. They include: procedural justice, interactional justice and distributive justice. \n",
      "2. Equity: Employees want to know the organisation is equitable. Equity in this terms means issues like what the organisation makes and what people are being payed. What is the pay distribution between the senor employees and junior employees?\n",
      "3. One size does not Fit All: An organisation must recognise that it is not one size fits all. Organisations are likely to have more than one generation of employees.  Some organisations have committed the error of believing that the same policies motivate each of the employees across different generations. Take for instance, this organisation that promised the employees who stay till retirement a huge gratuity. This promise may motivate the output of baby boomers because they are already looking at retirement, but this is a very ineffective strategy for the millennials who do not plan to stay for more than 5 years.\n",
      "4. Opportunity to Alternate Income Streams/Flexible Work Hours: In a recession, some organisations give their employees different opportunities to generate revenue in order to help motivate them.  What may been seen as a conflict of interest in the past will be waved in order to help employees. For instance, some organisations may give their employees an opportunity to work from home, or allow their employees have their own small businesses as long as it does not affect their output and productivity. \n",
      "5. Productivity Driven Reward: Employers should reward their employees for their performance on certain tasks, this encourages employees especially employees that do highly repetitive jobs. For instance if an employee has a target of bringing 10 clients to an organisation per week, and ends up bringing 20, the employee should get rewarded for this as this increases motivation and productivity. ​\n",
      "In the printing media and academic discussions, the issue of the leadership problem in Africa is a popular one. Africa has abundance of resources, and is set to be the zone with the highest growth potential and a place of choice in the world. However, this cannot be realised unless the issue of leadership is addressed and resolved. Former American President, Barak Obama, in one of his trips to Africa, instituted the Young African Leadership Initiative (YALI) to train future leaders for Africa. I think this is an indictment on the past and present leaders in Africa, and an insinuation that the young ones must be trained to avoid the endemic actions of past African leaders, that put the continent in its current predicament. I was involved in one of their sessions, and the zeal I saw among African youths is encouraging; this gave me the momentum to think deeply of how the desire of these young men and women for a better Africa in their days can be realised. \n",
      "The current leaders in Africa are having their ways because of the weak institutions and incapacitated political system unable to offer the check-and-balance required for good governance. For example, an African leader can easily amend his/her country's constitution to allow him/her to stay in office forever because of the lapses in the system. African leaders discard the notion that there is a limit to which an individual can be innovative in a certain situation. People run out of ideas even in organisations when they stay in it for a long time. I may not know the number of years, but it cannot be the twenty and more years that African leaders aim to stay in office. \n",
      "While reviewing the situation, and studying the pattern of political discussions in Africa, I concluded that Africa can create strong institutions and vibrant political systems, if those in leadership look beyond their narrow self-interest and consider the general good of all. Thus, the logical starting point is to ensure that the young up-coming African leaders understand the appropriate leadership mindset, and are socialised to accept it as the way forward, if Africa must take its proper position in the world. For the purpose of this discussion, I will define leadership mindset as why the leader opted to become a leader. Behaviour drives what we achieve;this relationship is open and can be inferred by all. However, there is a hidden determinant of our behaviour andmindset, which drives the behaviours we enact as leaders. What I intend to do in this discussion is to explain the various mindsets that leaders can have, and to describe what behaviours emanate from each mindset. \n",
      "The Arbinger Institute1 looked at leadership mindset from a dimension which I label 'who it benefits.' In this classification, you can have internal mindset (benefiting self) and external mindset (benefitting others). A person with internal mindset is in leadership for what he/she can obtain. Some will define self widely to include, may be, village circle, but not more than that. A person with external mindset is in leadership for the legacy that will be left for people. Such a person does not hate him/her self, but he/she knows that leadership is all about making a difference, not in the narrow sense of the internal mindset, but for the benefit of all. Carol Dweck2 also looked at mindset from another dimension which I label 'dynamics'. This classification yields fixed mindset (does not allow for change), and growth mindset (believes that change can occur and must be encouraged). Leaders with fixed mindset believe that issues and situations are fixed and remain so forever. They believe that change comes with high risk that one should not even attempt it. For some of these people, the ruling class is fixed and others should not attempt to enlarge this class, and people should even not clamor for this because of the high risk involved. If forced to give up power, they make it impossible for whoever is there to show that they and their group are superior. People with growth mindset are open to every possibility of change provided the change will produce a better society and self. Such people encourage the search for alternatives that are better than what they are offering. However, I think none of these classifications taken singly explains the dynamics of leadership in Africa. Hence, I combined them to arrive at the classification in the figure below:\n",
      "As much as possible African countries do not want to have leaders who are internal. This is because a person with internal mindset does not respect the big picture. To such leaders, leadership is a status, and followers are slaves that exist to serve the leader and obey his/her commands.  Leaders with internal and fixed mindset (quadrant 4) do not believe that any other person has the solution to a country's problem. They fight to remain in power even when they know there is nothing to offer their country. Leaders with internal and growth mindset (quadrant 3) may encourage changes, but they will only allow the changes that benefit self. If they are forced to release power, they either bring in a crony that they know will continue their destiny or make it impossible for another person to excel so they can prove their superiority over everybody. African leaders are mainly in quadrants 3 and 4 because of the weak institutions and incapacitated political systems. These self-centered leaders are always manipulating both to achieve their selfish motives. \n",
      "Fixed/external leaders (quadrant 1) care for people, but believe that solution lies in one set of people. They believe that nature has allocated power to some people, and such people must protect it at all cost. They either use political or ethnic affiliation to mark out the boundary of power. When they leave office, they become godfathers appointing only those who are loyal and 'know' the problem of everybody. The weak institution and incapacitated political system create a favorable environment for such leaders to thrive. As a result of the fixed nature of their mindset, they will oppose vehemently any attempt to establish strong institutions and political systems that will be  able to exercise control over them. \n",
      "The best leaders are in quadrant 2, Growth/external. These leaders care for people and want the best for people. They will support any source of best governance. They believe that one person cannot provide the solution to a nation's problem all the time. They believe that leaders must be groomed and allowed to take the stage. Leaders with growth/external mindset do not stay beyond their tenure no matter what you do or say to them. These leaders have no problem with strong institutions and capable political system, because they would not go contrary to the demands of any. \n",
      "Unfortunately, Africa is in its current predicament because most of its past and present leaders have always been from quadrants 1, 3, and 4.  What Africa needs in future leaders is the growth/external mindset, quadrant 2. Unless these young ones are directed appropriately, they may end up in the other undesirable quadrants when mentored by the same old brigades. I am advocating that while the youths form coalition, they should bear this in mind. African countries need 'saviors 'and I found in the African youths that gathered for the seminar a desire and hunger to be these 'saviors'. What they need is proper direction and mentoring by those with the mindset in quadrant 2. Mindset is not a stable personality trait that has low probability of change. One can unlearn bad mindset and learn good ones. What the youths require is appropriate training to expose them to the dangers in mindsets in quadrant 1, 3, and 4. \n",

      "It was a bright and undramatic Wednesday morning.  Feeling a bit bored, I decided to evaluate the New Year resolutions I had meticulously penned down on January 1, 2017. I was doing quite well on the first two on my list, struggling with the third. Remembering my measures of central tendency, I scored myself an Average using the arithmetic Mean, the Median and the Mode. Not too bad for the beginning of the year! I was writing more, eating less…well, still shopping. Some things just take time, I reckoned consolingly. A wide self-deprecating grin spread across my face.\n",
      "Proud of my almost 40 days of forfeiting most of the culinary luxuries of life - ice cream, fruit cake, fruit juice, fruit pastilles, yummy chocolate bars and all, I basked in the euphoria. Seated at the breakfast table, I traded orange juice for green tea, calorie-laden white bread for a bowl of Quaker oats and a bar of Mars Chocolate for a handful of Almond nuts. With a belly still rumbling with hunger but 'will' satiated, it was time to prepare for the next class. I walked back to my office calmly without any premonition of the events that will follow shortly after.\n",
      "A letter just came in the mail. Not the Postmaster kind of mail which is delivered from door to door. No, not a mail in an envelope neatly labelled with the recipient's name and address, placed inside the pigeon hole in the mail section of the ground floor of the business school.  This type pops up in your handheld device, with a distinct sound that announces its arrival, whether night or day. The address looked familiar, and so did the sender. Instinctively, I knew it was not from our climes, it came from far yonder. Did it bring good tidings? I wondered. I took in some breaths, momentarily paused and then I opened it. Well, I clicked on it as I walked on.\n",
      "It started well, with some nice appreciation for my time (energy?), with some acknowledgement of my output (input?), and some other phrases in the valley of the hills called 'niceties'. Then came the bombshell. The harbinger of disappointing news. An anti-climax of some sort, it was for me...a rejection letter for an academic paper I had submitted since last year. I was quiet for a while, read the 'love' note a couple of times, stared at nothing... and gave little smiles to colleagues that passed by, oblivious of the silent tears welling up inside me. Walked in a mini daze.\n",
      "I decided to read the email again as I sat at my desk. Perhaps, I missed out some parts. Perhaps, there were some 'alternative facts' I missed out. I read again. Same details as the first time. What was I expecting? \n",
      "How can I describe my feelings? I had been hopeful. Flashbacks of events of 2016.  I remembered the sleepless nights, the midnight candles, and the endless search for data, the writing up stage and the chocolates I consumed as I worked tirelessly. Yes, I recalled the chocolates, vividly.\n",
      "I didn't feel like doing anything again that day, I suddenly lost the zeal to put in much effort into that type of research activity, again. I just didn't have the energy to start some work where the outcome could not be predicted. However, a different kind of zeal unexpectedly surged forward. The zeal to binge suddenly returned from its far-flung journey of December 31 as I opened my black handbag and brought out 'my former best pal'. A giant bar of Mars Chocolate – big, black, yummy, foreign (well, 'made' in Dublin). Ever present in the handbag (out of habit), but I was never tempted to nibble, well since the new year.\n",
      "Compartmentalising my emotions, I went into the classroom, disposition best described as cheery. The session participants smiled at me, I smiled back as I orchestrated smoothly – with a belly filled with scrumptious chocolate (they could never have guessed!). We discussed the changing landscape due to digital economy - Uber, Airbnb, Amazon, Wakanow – strategies to succeed in the new economy. It was a good session.  Class over, it was time to go home. I made a mental note to replenish my depleted supply of chocolate…Aha! \n",
      "Nightfall, the weather is cool. Taking another bite of my favourite chocolate bar retrieved from the kitchen pantry, I gradually forgot my New Year resolution as I pondered, yet again on the life of an Academic.The thrills, the highs, the lows….paper acceptances, paper rejections, conference presentations, travels, et al., feelings best described as ambivalent.\n",
      "Suddenly, I felt an urge to pick up my phone again, a pull from my cocoa-binge-induced pity-party. A WhatsApp message. I clicked open. A friend just sent a quote from Dr Martin Luther King Jr. \n",
      "How profound! An Epiphany. Accept finite disappointment? Yes, I will accept the paper rejection and move on. Never lose infinite hope. Yes, there is a silver lining in every cloud. The tides suddenly turned. Once again, I am motivated. I am energised. I will pick up myself again. I will start again. I will work on the paper again, improve on it and resubmit to another journal. Opening the Venetian blinds slightly, I looked out of the window. Lagos skyline looked so beautiful. The clouds had gathered since sunset, and the winds blew cool breeze into my bedroom. Hope arose in my bosom. Like lightning flashing across the sky, two very compelling words 'I will' flooded my thoughts.\n",
      "Making presentations is an unavoidable part of life. Whether one is trying to convince parents to get a new pair of shoes, or making a sales pitch to a company's management team about a new product, or teaching a class of students a complicated subject, presentations are part of daily routine. With formal presentations, the need for effectiveness cannot be underscored. For a presentation to be good and effective, the presenter should of necessity, commit to adequate preparation and this holds true even for spontaneous (off-the-cuff) speeches common with government officials and top business executives. \n",
      "According to Dale Carnegie, \"a well-prepared speech is already nine-tenths delivered.\" Consider also Abraham Lincoln's famous statement: \"If I had six hours to chop down a tree, I'd spend the first four hours sharpening the axe\", and you would realize that even some of the greatest orators to walk the earth valued the task of preparing well. Effective and adequate preparation is the lifeblood of successful presentations. It is the largely unseen proverbial drummer that beats away in the nearby bush while the happy bird dances brilliantly on the foot path. It is the quiet but unyielding force that propels great orators to delight audiences and birth revolutions. It is from the activities of the 'dark closets' of preparation, that podiums are lighted with candor, confidence, charisma and creativity.\n",
      "Successful presentations are products of intense search and discovery of relevant information. Experts call this 'brooding over the topic'. Amazing orators like Abraham Lincoln confessed to the 'magic' that proper information gathering can do. Whether you are preparing to face an interview panel for a new job, or a committee to defend your contract proposal, or preparing to deliver some moralistic preachment to a congregation; in-depth information gathering should be a necessary first step to success. As you sit in silence in the car, bus, train or airplane, or as you lay on your bed during those still, silent moments before you drift away to sleep, you should think about the topic and write down striking thoughts. Use the internet, gather information from relevant print materials, and listen to people who would provide valuable insights, pay attention to underlying messages from events, widen the subject, enlarge the mind, push beyond the limits and be outstanding. \n",
      "Having the right information on a subject does not only boost the presenter's confidence on stage, it also makes the audience feel a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction, especially if new and useful information which translates to learning is provided. \n",
      "This is my coinage for reflection and deep contemplation; the necessity of the presenter to get deeply immersed in the message until it becomes 'his own.' Failure to first get absorbed and engrossed in your message makes you inauthentic and at best, academic. Research has shown that people are unconsciously drawn to a speaker who they feel has a real message to deliver in his head and heart and zealously desires to communicate that message straight to his listeners' heads and hearts. Preaching to oneself breeds belief and inspires passion for delivery. If the message is not understood, internalized and accepted by the messenger, one would not be surprised when a somewhat aloof and mechanical presentation activity is put forth.  \n",
      "Considering in advance, the peculiarities of your audience, is critical to success in presentations. Take time to decipher their needs. Find out the number of people you would be talking to, the time (before or after a meal?), their age range, professional standings (where necessary). Anticipate audience reaction and prepare to manage them. Some listeners would appreciate humor from time to time; some would consider you unserious or a time waster if you breach the solemnity of the occasion with what they think is unnecessary comedy. Some people appreciate more visuals than words; some prefer statistical analysis tools – graphs, tables and charts than sentences or pictures. Some appreciate bullet-point summary of the message. The mindset of your audience is important too. Speaking to a group of philosophers who may generally question most statements you make requires a different approach to delivering your best friend's toast at his wedding. \n",
      "'Practice makes perfect' is not just a worn-out cliché, it is an eternal call to duty in all spheres of life. Why would football players spend five days in rigorous training and strenuous exercise regimes only to run around the pitch chasing a ball for 90 minutes? How about other athletes, musicians, and so on who spend weeks and months to rehearse only to perform for a short time? Rehearsing a presentation the way you will deliver it is highly recommended by experts. Stand, move around, envision your audience, call out the words and act out your script in advance. This will not make you look inauthentic; it would rather serve as needed reminders when you step on that stage. Your mind would play back those moments, and echo those words as you said them in your room and you will have an easier time delivering the goods on stage. \n",
      "Going through your presentation the way you would deliver it on stage would also help you restrict yourself to acting within the boundaries of allotted time. You do not want the surprise of discovering that you had run out of time just mid-way into your talk. This can dishearten as well as embarrass you.  \n",
      "As part of your preparation process, you should seek constructive feedback from colleagues, friends and family members. If possible, rehearse before someone who would be candid with feedback. You can subscribe to a speaking/communications club and make use of the feedback mechanisms of such groups. You may record videos of yourself rehearsing and forward to group members who would watch and criticize. You could send a copy of the presentation to experts to dissect the content and make comments.

      "Just recently, I facilitated a seminar for the Lagos Judiciary at Lagos Business School with the theme Digital Economy and Legal Regulation. The aim of the seminar was to share insights on the emerging digital economy with their Lordships, and draw attention to the imperative for regulatory evolution in the face of the pervasiveness of online platforms of the kind operated by technology giants, such as Facebook, Google, Uber and Airbnb. There is hardly an area of economic and social interaction these days that is untouched by these platforms in some way.\n",
      "To fill the regulatory gaps in the digital economy, these behemoths have resorted to what could be referred to as spontaneous deregulation. I first encountered this term in an article by Benjamin Edelman and Damien Geradin, and has arisen as a result of digital disrupters ignoring laws and regulations that appear to preclude their business model, which is typically based on providing platforms for crowd sourcing and giving rise to the sharing economy. Believing in the efficacy of their utility model and its appeal to a pent up global demand, these disrupters seem to see many rules and regulations as belonging to the past and impractical for today's innovative clime. They, therefore, simply ignore them, opting for their own version of self-regulation, usually based on a mutual rating system between service providers and consumers. It is this skirting of existing regulations that is referred to as spontaneous private deregulation.\n",
      "These disrupters make the rules for themselves as they go along because, in fairness to them, as their platforms reshape markets, the scope of activity subject to regulation tends to decrease, and various forms of protection disappear. These companies operate in interstitial areas of the law because they present new and fundamentally different issues that were not foreseen when the governing statutes and regulations were enacted. \n",
      "Two major areas in which these digital behemoths  have riled the establishment are in transportation and hospitality; the major 'culprits' being Uber and Airbnb. Uber, until recently a relatively unknown company out of Silicon Valley in California, employs 160,000 drivers today and is adding an average of 20,000 drivers every month. This transport services disrupter is now valued at $41b, and operates in many major cities across the globe. Airbnb, a previously obscure company with similar roots and reach, has over 1.5m accommodation on its platform, and is now valued at $25b.\n",
      "Axelle Lemaire, French Secretary of State in charge of all things digital, insists that France is open to platform operators, but consumers have to be protected. She is sponsoring a law to be passed by the French Parliament which will create the principle of 'platform fairness.' Karnataka State in India, where Uber piloted its India service two years ago, has directed taxi aggregators, such as Uber, to stop operations in the State until they secure a licence from the government, triggering sharp reactions from the corporate world. Getting a licence would mean no more surge pricing, complying with the maximum fares fixed by the government periodically and registering with local transport authorities. The question is\" why has it taken the Karnataka government such a long time to wake up to regulatory gaps in her transport sector?\" And how many other cities are in this quagmire?\n",
      "The United States Supreme Court recently ended a decade-long battle over Google's massive book-scanning project, declining to take up an appeal by authors who claimed the company violated copyright law ''on an epic scale.'' The justices denied certiorari in Authors Guild v. Google, 15-849, leaving in place a ruling handed down last year by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit that said Google's project was permissible. The appeals court decision invoked the ''fair use'' doctrine, which permits some ''socially beneficial'' use of published works, such as news reporting or research, which would otherwise constitute copyright infringements.\n",
      "Airbnb has had its fair share of issues with one of its largest markets, New York. A major concern is the legal regime within which Airbnb operates; one which is marked by poorly drafted laws that fail to account for challenges presented by the sharing economy. As explained by Airbnb cofounder Brian Chesky, \"There were laws created for businesses and there were laws for people. What the sharing economy did was create a third category: people as businesses,\" to which the application of existing laws is often unclear. These new business models raise complex questions that have not yet been addressed by either legislatures or courts.\n",
      "Because the threat of enforcement actions can have a chilling effect on start-ups and their users, state and local government officials should consider how their actions may affect burgeoning businesses. Officials should encourage the sharing economy's growth through collaborative efforts rather than seek to protect incumbent businesses.\n",
      "The slow pace of regulation evolution seems to strongly suggest that the legal profession itself is ripe for a technological revolution that will optimise the largely manual and laborious process of enacting laws and regulations in the face of the aggressive pace of digital innovation.\n",
      "I recall the indignation of their Lordships when I cautioned that the learned profession could be more vulnerable than they think when it comes to disruption, and that emerging technologies like cognitive computing and other forms of machine learning can help narrow the gap between regulation and innovation. \n",
      "Much as it may sound improbable, given its intrinsic consultative nature, I was not surprised when I came across an article on the World Economic Forum's collaborative platform, announcing that a Law firm, Baker & Hostetler, had done just that!\n",
      "According to the article, Baker & Hostetler has announced that it is employing IBM's AI, Ross, to handle its bankruptcy practice, which at the moment consists of nearly 50 lawyers. Ross, \"the world's first artificially intelligent attorney\" built on IBM's cognitive computer, Watson, was designed to read and understand language, postulate hypotheses when asked questions, research, and then generate responses (along with references and citations) to back up its conclusions. Ross also learns from experience, gaining speed and knowledge the more you interact with it.\"You ask your questions in plain English, as you would a colleague, and Ross then reads through the entire body of law and returns a cited answer and topical readings from legislation, case law and secondary sources to get you up-to-speed quickly,\" the website says. \"In addition, Ross monitors the law around the clock to notify you of new court decisions that can affect your case.\"\n",
      "Ross also minimises the time it takes by narrowing down results from a thousand to only the most highly relevant answers, and presents the answers in a more casual, understandable language. It also keeps up-to-date with developments in the legal system, specifically those that may affect your cases. According to CEO and co-founder Andrew Arruda, other firms have also signed licenses with Ross, and they will also be making announcements shortly.\n",
      "This disruption, happening to the most unlikely profession, with a highly codified ethic, is a clear manifestation that no industry is immune from disruption in the impending fourth industrial revolution. Any industry that does not figure out how to be a part of it might as well write their obituaries. My takeaway, expressed to their Lordships after the seminar, was that the digital revolution is like a train whose drivers are the entrepreneur disrupters. The passengers are the global customers with a pent up demand for the value and convenience that they provide. Naysayers to this phenomenon can stand in front of the train and be crushed, stay on the platform and be left behind or come on board for a ride into progressive partnership.\n",
      "Regulators still have much to learn about how to deal with digital platforms. They have no choice than to get more involved and get the needed expertise. But will they? The jury is still out.\n",

      "Amazon aspires to make drone deliveries for its Prime service. Uber, the dominant taxi service for the digital age, is experimenting with self-driving cars; Google, which has been testing self-driving cars for years, is also rumored to have a taxi service in mind. How will new autonomous technologies impact the lives of consumers and shape businesses, and what is the role of governments in shaping them? Global Network Perspectives asked our Faculty, Dr 'Yinka David-West for her perspective.\n",
      "GNP: How will new forms of autonomous technology—drones, self-driving cars, new forms of robotics—likely change our lives and create new business models?\n",
      "Dr David-West: New forms of autonomous technologies will certainly have an impact on lives, society and business. As these technologies gradually reduce human-human interactions in favour of either human-machine or machine-machine interactions, we are bound to see changing business and interaction models. While these may ease existing operational and business constraints, their transformative nature also bring about disruptions in some industries and redefine the human capabilities required in others.\n",
      "Firstly, business processes in service-oriented industries will be challenged to better support growing digital channels and relationship management strategies for the \"always\" connected customers with ever-changing value propositions. As such, software platforms (and bots) will form part of organisations' critical infrastructure. Secondly, in the case of industrial businesses, hardware advancements in machinery and equipment using sensors and wireless communications networks will become standard. These will lead to the real-time aggregation and transmission of data about the machine or the context in which it is being used as we see with health data and wearables.\n",
      "In both cases, the increased use of information technologies will result  in a data surge (or overload) that will require analytical capabilities to help business managers draw better insights. In order to effectively harness this data, new organisational capabilities in the field of data sciences and related partnerships will be essential. The changing customer value propositions will demand for agile organisations with flexible product design capabilities to meet customer needs. In addition, new opportunities for operational efficiency, especially in the areas of capacity utilisation and reduced downtime, will also be harnessed.​\n",
      "GNP: How have new autonomous technologies already impacted businesses working in your country or region? What opportunities and threats do they present?​\n",
      "Dr David-West: The impact of these autonomous technologies varies from country to country in Africa, especially due to the dependence on public infrastructure; a weakness of most sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries. For example, in the Global Information Technology Report 2016, the latest iteration of the Networked Readiness Index (NRI), which ranks technology readiness in 139 countries, shows SSA countries underperforming (see figure 1 for rank performance of SSA countries). Outside of South Africa and Mauritius ranked 65th and 49th respectively, other countries ranked in the bottom half.\n",
      "While access to public infrastructure delimits impact in SSA, examples of existing opportunities and threats of different technologies are highlighted across industries.\n",
      "Dr David-West:​ Generally, the responses are somewhat lackadaisical. However, telecom companies that are witnessing declining revenues from voice and messaging services in favour of data-oriented alternatives are being forced to review their business models and diversify investments. For example, the South-African MTN Group is a member of the African Internet Group (AIG), an internet platform company and member of the German incubator, Rocket Internet. AIG operates digital platforms across different industries and markets on the Continent.  To further enhance its digital service offerings, MTN has also established ICT startup incubators in South Africa and Nigeria.\n",
      "Although several African governments are seeking to build digital jobs, governments' ability to understand and develop regulatory guidelines for emerging technologies usually occur after their adoption. ​\n"

Clients or other supervisors can be used as references if you are uncomfortable requesting one from your current employer.

If you do not use a current employer, you should comment on the reasons for this in the optional essay.\n",

We recommend preparing for the GMAT/GRE well before the test date so that you are not struggling to take the test, write your MEMBA application, and manage your day-to-day life all at once.\n",
      "The Admissions Committee hopes that all applicants will recognize the following:  the full range of GMAT scores is very broad, that there is no \"minimum\" score requirement, and that the GMAT is just one piece of data among the many used to evaluate an application.\n",

You may upload an \"unofficial\" or student copy of your transcript; however, we will expect an official copy from your school for verification purposes should you be admitted to LBS.\n",

For MBA participants, the institution provides further industry immersion opportunities with participants spending three months in the internship programme, providing professional services in a local or multinational company. The experience creates a convergence of theory and practice.  MEMBA participants are exposed to one week of educational activities in Spain or Singapore.\n",

Graduation from these programmes will enhance your business management knowledge, interpersonal skills, and ethical reasoning thus putting you ahead of your peers in all spheres.  Our graduates also join a community of professionals (LBS Alumni) that provides a forum for networking throughout your career.\n",

While LBS is not the only business management education institution in Nigeria, we are proud of our programmes , the faculty and administrators responsible for delivering the programmes, and the collegial atmosphere  the institution has created to enable desired learning outcomes. LBS attracts the best and the brightest faculty members, who impart knowledge and conduct research, to make sure the institution is at the cutting edge of management education and business practice.  LBS also partners with other international institutions, such as IESE Business School, to broaden participants' exposure to faculty and students around the world.\n",

The curriculum ensures exposure to core management principles, and electives are offered to tailor your learning to your personal interests and career goals.  While all course instructions are anchored on the Harvard case-study method of teaching, LBS has gone a step further by developing local case studies that hone in on problems faced by companies within emerging markets.  The case studies provide a robust sampling of potential business problems a manager would encounter in business management practice. For MBA participants, the institution provides further industry immersion opportunities with participants spending three months in the internship programme, providing professional services in a local or multinational company. The experience creates a convergence of theory and practice.  EMBA participants are exposed to one week of educational activities in Spain.\n",

      "During one of the panel discussions, Modupe Ladipo, Board Chairman of EfinA, said that Nigeria's policies should be customer-centric and factored into global best practices to achieve financial inclusion objective in Nigeria. \"Our policies must meet global standards of operations. We need regulators to be more flexible, and we need a diversity of players to provide financial services that would satisfy customers,\" she said.\n",
      "Modupe further explained that consumer protection was essential in financial inclusion as different consumers have different needs. \"As a matter of necessity, we need to embark on research to know what our diverse population of consumers want. Let us move from office-led practice of operations to a consumer-led practice,\" she counselled.\n",
      "Jones Onyereri, Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Banking and Currency, stated that legislators were doing their best to ensure that Nigeria is financially inclusive in the comity of nations. \"The Cyber Crimes and Electronic Transactions Act were passed by the legislative body in Nigeria to bolster financial inclusion in Nigeria.

      "Dr Christopher Kolade, former Pro-Chancellor of Pan-Atlantic University, Lagos, said that one of Onosode's top concerns about Nigeria, the business sector and public sector was the poverty of management performance in many places.

He further thanked the LBS and members of the family for embarking on the project to accomplish the vision of a visionary leader.\n",

Essentially, these pre-module sessions involve having a number of online group meetings per course where pre-module cases would be analyzed and discussed among group members. These synchronous group meetings last for 1hr 15 minutes per meeting. Thereafter, each group member is required to turn in reports on the analysis of the assigned cases. All group members are required to log in at their own convenience and participate in the group meetings for the stipulated periods. Assignments are to be submitted and records of attendance will be taken by the MEMBA programme manager. \n",

      "Post-Module Learning Activities: Between on-campus modules, there are two sets of activities to help participants apply the learning points from class sessions to the workplace: online discussion forums and practice based learning activities. Online discussion forums are administered by the faculty with the assistance of the programme manager. Each discussion forum typically lasts for 2 hours and the LMS or related tools are used for asynchronous participation.   The participating faculty is usually available to give feedback and responses.  The second activity is the practice based learning activity where faculty give practical exercises in each course to the participants to help them put the class learning into practice in the work place.  The MBA department works closely with faculty teaching in the MEMBA programme to identify suitable practice exercises that are not too time consuming and that meet the requirements of each course. \n",

      "Impact investments are financial investments made with the intention to generate and measure a positive social and environmental impact alongside a financial return.\n",
      "Through investing in areas like sustainable agriculture, SME development and job creation, affordable housing, accessible healthcare, education, clean technology, and financial services for the poor, impact investments have generated a range of financial returns from below market to market rate.\n",
      "Impact investors are attracted to investment opportunities by the ability to generate attractive commercial returns while directly contributing to positive social and environmental outcomes.\n",
      "The Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN) 2014 Investor Survey reports that USD 10.6bn worth of impact investments were made in 2013, which is expected to increase by 19% to USD 12.7bn in 2014.\n",
      "A key indication of this growth is the transition of impact investing from its traditional home in philanthropy and development finance to mainstream investors like pension funds, companies, investment banks and asset managers.\n",
      "In 2013, for the first time, impact investing was on the agendas at both the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos, and the G8 meetings.\n",
      "Impact investment as an industry in Southern Africa is in its infant stages compared to the northern markets and is held back by lack of a common language, high search and transaction costs, a lack of regulatory infrastructure, lack of common metrics, weak project flow and poor intermediation.\n",
      "As in any infant market, some of these challenges can be overcome by building an active impact investing network where buyers, sellers, intermediaries and regulators of impact capital can come together to build knowledge, common understanding, and importantly, to do deals.\n",
      "The success of global impact investing networks like GIIN illustrate the positive role that networks can play in market development by building, linking and supporting the market participants.\n",
      "South Africa is in many ways a perfect testing ground for impact investment. It contains some of the most sophisticated financial infrastructure and successful private sector businesses in the world. At the same time, it has an urgent imperative for growth and infrastructure development. Impact investment may also provide a mechanism for South Africa to pursue some of its other special objectives, like Broad-based Black Economic Empowerment, job creation and land reform.\n",
      "The Southern African network for Impact Investing event is a platform where all potential players in this rapidly changing field can meet and address the barriers that exist to large-scale impact investment.\n",

      "“Why does it make business sense to measure impact?” asked Salma Seedat of GreaterImpact, speaking on behalf of the GIIN.\n",
      "In the talks that followed, Karim Harji (Purpose Capital), Patrick Oketa (Acumen) and Beth Richardson (B Lab) answered this question many times over, including the following highlights:\n",
      "Following this debate, presentations by Shani Kay (of Regency Global) and Emma Dicks (of Code for Cape Town) looked at the importance of telling impact stories to further the agenda of impact growth.\n",
      "“We need to broaden the vison of the investor community, to show them that something new and beneficial for everyone can emerge,” said Kay. “We don’t have to achieve perfect outcomes. The real, sincere experience of people is irrefutable, and this should be added to impact assessments.”\n",
      "Emma Dicks illustrated this by telling stories of young entrepreneurs, suggesting that young people need to be given the freedom to explore the viability of all their ideas before they find the one worth investing in.\n",
      "“What looks a bit like investment is actually fuelling the education of young people to become investible in future,” Dicks said. “We need to invest in individuals.”\n",
      "This idea was expanded upon in the next couch-style discussion with Ryan Harrison, Co-founder of SPARK Schools. He noted that there’s an innate misunderstanding in South Africa that social and profit don’t go together. “People think you cannot do well and progress social justice,” he said.\n",
      "It’s successful social entrepreneurs like Harrison that are disproving this, and impact investing has a big role to play in this process.\n",
      "Just before lunch, the theoretical talk was interrupted by an exciting Dragon’s Den-style session, where four social entrepreneurs pitched their ideas to a panel of judges to see if they have what it takes. The overwhelming winner, voted for by both the judges and the audience, was Nthabiseng Legoete from Qualihealth, who delivered a powerful pitch about an initiative that’s democratising healthcare in South Africa (impressively, having brought her nine-day old baby!).\n",
      "The afternoon sessions included TED-style talks with John Oliphant (UNDP), who discussed infrastructure investing and development in Africa, and Simba Marekera (Christian Super), who looked at faith-based impact investing. Tomas Sales (UNDP) then discussed financial inclusion and sustainable development, and Royston Braganza (Grameen Capital) and Vipal Kumar (Ennovent) shared some impact investing lessons from India.\n",
      "The day ended with an open forum facilitated by Aunnie Patton-Power from the Bertha Centre, where the audience participated in a lively discussion on topics like: the need for a Pan-African impact investing advisory body, segmentation of conversations with investors and social enterprises, and the question whether environmental criteria are sufficiently developed when it comes to making impact investing decisions.\n",
      "In closing, Salma Seedat noted: “What’s inspiring is that year on year (we’ve had five SAIIN conferences now) I can see the growth happening and how the conversation is changing. People want to know where they can get more info, what’s happening next and how to make things happen.”\n",

      "We are sitting in a transitional period. Governments realise that they cannot solve the myriad of social problems that they face on their own. The not-for-profit sector valiantly attempts to do so, but with limited resources. A structured approach is lacking, with organisations each dealing with different parts of the value chain of a social problem in isolation. And what’s more, although their impact might be positive, it is not always known or tracked.\n",
      "The world is changing. In the 20th century, we had risk and return. The 21st century demands another investment solution and that solution lies in marrying risk, return and impact. Intrinsically we are already doing this, we just don’t realise it. It is what Sir Ronald Cohen calls “the invisible heart of the market” – the measurement of impact, which he believes will guide many more investment decisions in the future.\n",
      "Several important drivers are shifting the investing landscape. Firstly, we have governments that cannot cope with the scale and complexity of social issues. Secondly, we have a generation of Millennials who want to do more with their lives than make money. Thirdly, the investment community signatories to the UNPRI recognises it has a duty to realise more than just financial returns. And finally you have the not-for-profits and social enterprises themselves that want to grow, to scale up and have a larger impact on solving social problems.\n",
      "Impact investing has to have measurable societal or environmental goals, which coexist with financial returns. It sits between philanthropy and ESG or socially responsible investing, and it is disrupting both ends of that spectrum. A business that makes a 20% ROI is not going to be as attractive an investment when compared to a business that makes a 20% ROI and a 35% social return. It is our belief that in the future, a business that just makes money is not going to be a popular business.\n",
      "This is the impact revolution – led by millennials – who will innovate and scale it, as they did with the technology revolution that preceded it.\n",

      "More and more people are starting to ask: “What should we do that’s significant with a significant amount of funding?”\n",
      "This was a central theme that emerged from the first day of the South African Impact Investing Network held at the Gordon Institute of Business Science (GIBS), where an impressive line-up of international, regional and local speakers and delegates gathered to share their thoughts, challenges and solutions.\n",
      "With a mixture of plenary panel discussions, TED-style talks and workshops, a broad range of topics were covered, from how we can strengthen the pipeline to B-BBEE in impact investing.\n",
      "A common thread that ran through various sessions was the need to continue to build on the existing collaboration in the sector. Speakers warned against conversations that isolate and advocated for smart solutions that are multi-faceted, addressing many issues or challenges at once.\n",
      "In the final plenary session of the day, Bridget Fury remarked what an interesting and diverse day it had been, and how delighted she was to see such a wide range of people (investors, intermediaries and social enterprises) in the room in comparison to last year’s conference.\n",
      "While the conversations highlighted that there’s still work to be done, the overall message is really positive. As Carmelo Cocuzza of the European Investment Bank noted, “The start-ups of today are going to be the corporates of tomorrow,” and people are ready and willing to nurture them.\n",

      "Karim Harji from ET Jackson & Associates and Purpose Capital talks about how impact measurement has the potential to be one of the most powerful catalysts for change across the continent. But only if we are brave enough…\n",
      "At the core of impact investing lie the concepts of intentionality and measurement. While it is important for investors to be clear about their impact investment thesis and how it will generate targeted financial and social returns, it is even more important to actually realize both these returns. After all, investors would never credibility explain performance in terms of aspirations; they would insist on knowing the precise financial repayment terms. So why don’t we have the same expectations around impact?\n",
      "Measuring impact is not an easy task, given the diverse preferences of stakeholders involved, and the evolving range of different frameworks and tools. If, however, impact investments are a means of creating financial and social value for both investors and communities, respectively, then we need to pay attention to both, together. Investors often spend a lot of time assessing impact goals at the due diligence phase, but it is not enough to stop there. We must ask the tough questions around ‘realized impact ‘.\n",
      "There has been progress on many related initiatives, including common metrics (IRIS), fund (GIIRS) and enterprise (B Corp) ratings, and household poverty assessments (PPI). Alignment with the SDGs, using “bottom up” approaches alongside “top down” ones, are also necessary. While these approaches and others have been successfully applied across several African countries, there is a need for more sophisticated adaptation to regional contexts, in order to improve relevance to local realities.\n",
      "In the African context, there are other important dimensions to consider. What happens if impact investments result in significant negative or unintended consequences? How should investors and investees react if there is a market opportunity as a result of poor government service delivery, or from civil or political unrest? Are investors obligated to consider the impact of their investments beyond their direct customers? To what extent should direct and indirect beneficiaries influence investment goals?\n",
      "Depending on how these issues are addressed, there will be visceral reactions and practical implications for customers, employees, beneficiaries, and households. In the absence of social safety nets in many regions in Africa, these are critical questions not only for investors, but also for the broader field. It will require all actors in the impact ecosystem, not just investors, to demonstrate courage in speaking “truth to power” in unpacking impact measurement – when things go well, and also when they do not.\n",
      "Impact investing can be a powerful tool to generate significant financial value and social impact for many regions in Africa. At the same time, there is still much to learn around when and how to best deploy capital, and impact measurement will be a critical component to identifying, analyzing, and sharing what is being learned. It has the potential to be a powerful catalyst for change. The fear and risk of things going wrong should not deter us from these collective efforts. But it will require an elevated degree of transparency, honesty and credibility for all involved.\n",

      "Reliance on biomass for cooking and heating forces women and children to spend hours each week collecting wood, time that could be better spent on income generation, education, or other activities. Where fuel must be purchased, primarily in urban areas, families struggling to meet their basic needs can pay as much as one-third of their income to purchase sufficient fuel to cook their daily meal.\n",
      "Replacing traditional cookstoves with more efficient technologies saves households time and money. In addition the clean cookstove and fuel value chain offers new pathways for local economic empowerment. Local entrepreneurs can participate in the clean cooking value chain, earning income from product design, engineering, manufacturing, marketing, distribution, and sales of clean cookstoves and fuels.\n",
      "Women can also catalyze the market as clean energy entrepreneurs by leading efforts to develop effective, culturally-appropriate, and sustainable solutions. Women entrepreneurs are an untapped resource and leveraging women’s strengths is a huge opportunity for the sector. Women’s networks can open doors for clean energy technology businesses and provide access to consumers in hard-to-reach markets and women distributors can often better understand the needs of other women and more easily approach their clients regarding the health, economic, and other benefits of clean cookstoves and fuels.\n",

      "The use of open fires and traditional cookstoves and fuels is one of the world's most pressing health and environmental problems. Globally, three billion people rely on solid fuels to cook, causing serious environmental and health impacts that disproportionally affect women and children. According to the World Health Organization, household air pollution from cooking kills over 4 million people every year and sickens millions more.\n",
      "Yet, safe, affordable, and accessible clean cooking solutions exist that can dramatically reduce fuel consumption and exposure to harmful cookstove smoke, while providing economic opportunities in communities around the world.  \n",
      "The Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves (Alliance), hosted by the UN Foundation, is at the forefront of efforts to promote the adoption of clean cooking solutions and spur universal adoption of clean cookstoves and fuels. Launched in September 2010 by former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Alliance has an ambitious 10-year goal to foster the adoption of clean cookstoves and fuels in 100 million households by 2020. The Alliance and its partners are working to establish a thriving global market for clean cooking solutions by addressing the market barriers that impede the production, deployment, and use of clean and efficient cookstoves and fuels in developing countries.\n",
      "In just five years, the Alliance and its partners have made significant strides toward developing a clean cookstoves and fuels sector that is poised to scale and built for sustainable growth. To read about the Alliance's progress at the halfway point of its 10-year strategy, visit Five Years of Impact. \n",
      "To tap the tremendous knowledge of the field, the Alliance convened 350 international experts from a cross-section of the clean cooking and related sectors to assess and address issues hindering the development of a thriving clean cookstoves and fuels markets at scale.  The Alliance’s broad consultative process led to the development of a range of short- and long-term recommendations that formed the basis for a report entitled Igniting Change: A Strategy for Universal Adoption of Clean Cookstoves and Fuels, The strategy fostered a unified vision for the sector, while building a common sense of engagement among stakeholders regarding the most essential actions required for universal adoption of clean cookstoves and fuels.  Igniting Change formed the basis for the Alliance’s Ten-Year Business Plan, and outlined a three-pronged approach for the creation of a dynamic market for clean cooking solutions by:\n",
      "Significant progress was made during Phase I in achieving the Alliance’s original goals and objectives, and the momentum is growing already in Phase II. To date, more than 50 million cleaner, more efficient cookstoves and fuels are in use and global awareness has grown significantly regarding the serious health, environmental, and livelihoods issues posed by household air pollution. The Alliance is actively driving investment into the sector, supporting capacity building for entrepreneurs, enhancing testing and knowledge centers, and engaging in new research in dozens of countries where national policies are identifying clean cooking solutions as integral to achieving improvements in energy access, women and children’s health, and the environment. This is most evident in the Alliance’s eight focus countries of Bangladesh, China, Ghana, Guatemala, India, Kenya, Nigeria, and Uganda where the Alliance has been instrumental in developing and shaping country action plans for further progress. The Alliance’s leadership has also been influential in the process to create the first-ever global standards for cookstove safety, efficiency, and cleanliness.\n",
      "Finally, in addition to its efforts on the ground, the Alliance made strong progress in integrating the issue of clean cooking as a means of achieving other critical development priorities -- health, energy, and environment -- by galvanizing major international organizations and initiatives, including the Sustainable Energy for All initiative, COP21, the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, the Sustainable Development Goals, Beijing+20, and the G20, among many others.\n",

      "Despite recent strides made in improved cookstove and fuel affordability and quality, consumers, distributors and manufacturers recognize a need for affordable financing options at scale. Often, typical financing options available in these markets, such as microfinance loans, are not attractive to microfinance institutions due to the low price point and high transaction costs. Thus, clean cooking technologies are too expensive for many consumers to pay up front and not expensive enough to be cost-effective for microfinance institutions (MFIs) and traditional banks.\n",
      "In addition, making cleaner cookstoves and fuels more widely available to end-users, especially to those households located in rural or remote places, remains a challenge.  Reaching these households remains difficult for many reasons, such as: the fragility of some cookstoves during transport over poor roads, the high cost of transportation, the limited availability of distributors, and lack of end-user awareness and willingness to pay.  \n",
      "The Alliance supports research informed activities to develop and enhance innovative and scalable distribution and consumer finance models and partnerships.  These activities include enterprise training and capacity building, brokering of partnerships, new product and guarantee development, pilot support, and sharing of best practices in integrating women in the value chain and tailoring products to meet consumer needs and preferences.\n",

      "Exposure to smoke from traditional cookstoves and open fires – the primary means of cooking and heating for nearly three billion people in the developing world – causes more than 4 million premature deaths annually, including over 5,000 deaths in Guatemala, every year.\n",
      "Exposure to smoke from cooking contributes to a range of chronic illnesses and acute health impacts such as early childhood pneumonia, emphysema, cataracts, lung cancer, bronchitis, cardiovascular disease, and low birth weight. Women and young children are the most affected, with 1,300 children in Guatemala dying annually as a result of acute lower respiratory infections caused by the use of solid fuels.\n",
      "More than 60% of Guatemala’s population relies on wood fuel for their household cooking and heating needs. Reliance on biomass for cooking and heating leads to environmental degradation from increased pressure on local natural resources and forces women and children to spend many hours each week collecting wood. Inefficient cooking also contributes to climate change through emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane, and aerosols such as black carbon.\n",
      "The use of cleaner and more efficient cookstoves and fuels can dramatically reduce exposure to harmful cooking smoke, can provide myriad economic opportunities for Guatemalans, and can help reduce forest degradation and slow climate change. More efficient stoves and cleaner fuels also reduce the time people—usually women and girls—need to spend collecting fuel, freeing up time for income generating activities or education.\n",

      "Based in Nairobi, the Mediae Company produces research-based educational entertainment to promote changes in knowledge, attitudes and practices across East Africa. Our award-winning TV and radio programs have millions of followers, and are a source of information that serves to empower audiences. Over more than 20, years we have covered a vast range of social issues impacting the lives of millions.\n",
      "Our flagship series Shamba Shape Up is East Africa’s leading agricultural TV program and reaches up to 3 million viewers weekly. An assessment of the most recent season of Shamba Shape Up found that 80% of viewers reported learning something new, and 43% made changes to their farming practices as a result of watching the show. \n",
      "It was while filming Shamba Shape Up that our team witnessed first hand the critical conditions faced by families while cooking their daily meals. We saw a need to educate populations across Kenya about the benefits of clean cooking. The concept of a TV show centered in the kitchen was created.\n",
      "With support from the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves, and in collaboration with the Alliance’s partners in Kenya, we developed a weekly TV and radio series based on extensive research with the target audience. Content includes information about available cleaner cooking technologies as well as covering key issues on nutrition, with an emphasis on the first 1,000 days of a child’s life. Working with the Alliance has been invaluable to the success of creating evidence-based media that serves as an innovative behavior change communication tool.\n",
      "Shamba Chef is an entertaining reality-style TV show that takes viewers inside Kenyan homes, to watch as families learn how to prepare more nutritious meals while testing out a new stove or fuel that makes cooking “quicker, safer, cleaner and at half the cost”.  The series seeks to address a critical educational gap for the 80% of the Kenyan population who use dirty, polluting fuels for cooking, and address the 35% of Kenyan children under five who are stunted, as well as the millions more who are nutrient deficient.\n",
      "Shamba Chef debuted in September 2017 and is currently the number one rated show in its time slot. Episodes in Kiswahili and English have attracted a combined average of 3 million viewers per week. The show is supported by iChef an information service that offers subscribers weekly SMS tips and printed leaflets with healthy recipes, kitchen garden and nutrition tips and information on how to buy clean cookstoves. Audience are invited to SMS the call center to subscribe to this service, and in the first 10 weeks of broadcasting over 30,000 SMS were received, with over 10,000 subscribing to the service (65% of these subscribers are female).\n",
      "With support from the Alliance, Mediae is working on developing a second series of Shamba Chef, to build on generating the demand for clean cooking as well as continuing to address critical issues on nutritional practices.\n"

      "Geneva, Switzerland, 15 January 2018. Gold Standard has launched a new Gender Equality Framework within its standard ‘Gold Standard for the Global Goals’ to enable developers and funders of climate protection projects to quantify, certify and maximise contributions to empowering women and girls. The Framework, developed with support from the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, helps accelerate and track progress toward the UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 5 for Gender Equality. It features strengthened ‘Gender Sensitive’ Requirements that ensure projects anchor gender equality at the core of their design and ‘Gender Responsive’ Guidelines to assess the impact of projects proactively closing gender gaps.\n",
      "“Poverty, education, health, jobs and livelihoods, food security, and environmental and energy sustainability will not be solved without addressing gender inequality,” states Allie Glinski from the International Center for Research on Women (ICRW). “This framework has been developed recognising the transformative nature of empowering women as well as the need for gender-specific data to track progress toward meeting SDG 5.”\n",
      "By quantifying and certifying gender impacts, projects can tap into additional funding from an increasing pool of gender-lens investors and a rising demand to credibly report on what dollars have delivered through verified impact data.\n",
      "The Framework’s ‘Gender Sensitive Requirements,’ are obligatory to every Gold Standard-certified project and ensure that projects follow the latest best practices in, for example, consulting with a representative cross-section of local women and men and adhering to gender-sensitive safeguards. The Framework’s Gender Responsive Guidelines takes this further, assessing impact to a wide range of SDG 5 indicators depending on what a project developer or funder seeks to deliver, for example:\n",
      "Gold Standard CEO, Marion Verles, highlights the untapped potential in quantifying and maximising impact toward gender equality: “Ensuring women’s participation and leadership in decision making can lead to improved social outcomes like family health (SDG 3) and education (SDG 4). Giving women voice and agency can also be transformative in environmental management – from climate change mitigation to ecosystem conservation.” She continues, “If we’re serious about the bold ambition of ‘gender equality for all’, we need to know how we’re doing in the race to 2030 and, critically, get the most out of every development dollar we spend.”\n",
      "The first to apply the full Gender Equality Framework is a CO2Balance project in northern Uganda that rehabilitates boreholes to provide clean water access. These communities previously had to either drink unsafe water from nearby streams and risk suffering from life-threatening water borne illness, burn fuel to boil water, or travel long distances for clean water. Experts will monitor women’s time savings and how this translates to education or income-generating activities that lead to economic empowerment – a measurable impact toward SDG 5. They will also investigate how women’s representation on water resource committees can help improve their agency and empowerment in the community\n",
      "Other projects, including clean cooking solutions, renewable energy, forestry and agriculture will follow suit.\n",
      "The Gold Standard Gender Equality Framework was created in collaboration with experts from the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves, the International Center for Research on Women, Hivos International, Fair Climate Network, World Bank Group, International Finance Corporation, UN REDD and EcoAct.\n",
      "Organisations looking to help empower women and girls can support projects making a measurable difference in gender equality by funding Gold Standard Certified SDG 5 Impacts. Find out more here. Project developers who wish to apply the Gender Equality Framework may contact help@goldstandard.org to find out how to get started. \n",

      "Achieving universal adoption of clean cookstoves and fuels requires a sufficient supply of the products that customers value, at prices they can afford. This means supporting innovation, ensuring sufficient capital to finance the development, operation and growth of clean cooking businesses, as well as including women in the value-chain to strengthen the supply-side.\n",
      "Innovations are needed across the value chain – from product design to technology improvement to consumer finance. However, few funders take risks on unproven innovations, and investors do not often fund research and development without a ready-made market for the innovation. Grant investments are needed to develop better technologies and business models appropriate to the local context, and improve the fragmented value chains in many markets. Innovation grants can be instrumental in moving the sector forward by supporting proof of concept for potentially game changing ideas and sharing lessons learned from both successful and failed innovations. The Alliance’s Pilot Innovation Fund (PIF) provides grants of up to $150K to finance innovative approaches designed to strengthen supply of clean cookstoves and fuels. In return for seed capital to finance and pilot these innovations, recipients are required to document lessons learned and share their results to advance awareness of scalable solutions in the sector.\n",
      "Creating a thriving global market for clean cookstoves and fuels will require significant capital from a range of players in the financial sector at each stage of the cookstove supply value chain – research and development, manufacturing, marketing, distribution, and financing. The types of support needed range from early stage grant funding for start-up costs, to subsidized capital, angel equity investment, and ultimately commercial capital.\n",
      "In order to drive investment into the sector the Alliance is working to prepare the market for scale, support the development of commercially viable and scalable enterprise, and raise awareness in the investor community on the opportunities within the sector.\n",
      "The process of building an inclusive value chain entails involving a wide range of stakeholders in the development of new cookstove designs, local manufacturing projects, distribution efforts, marketing techniques, and awareness campaigns, among other areas.\n",
      "Women are a particularly important component of the value chain as they are responsible for the cooking. They should not be merely seen as end-users, and their inclusion throughout the value chain will increase the successful adoption of clean cookstoves and fuels as well as their long-term use.\n",
      "Women can be economically empowered by participating in, starting businesses around, and earning income from product design, engineering, manufacturing, marketing, distribution, sales, and other related enterprises, including the use of clean cooking technologies in businesses that involve cooking, such as restaurants and street food sales.\n",

      "Burning solid fuels in inefficient cookstoves releases toxic pollutants into the air leading to levels of household air pollution which often far exceed World Health Organization health-based guidelines. Unfortunately, the potential for harm does not stop when smoke leaves the home. Instead, in many areas, fine particulate emissions from household cooking with solid fuels are a major source of ambient (outdoor) air pollution. Household air pollution accounts for 12% of ambient air pollution globally and up to 30% of ambient air pollution in areas of South Asia and China. The ambient pollution which occurs as a result of household cooking with solid fuels has major implications for both human health and the environment.\n",
      "In addition to air pollution, burning solid fuels releases emissions of some of the most important contributors to global climate change: carbon dioxide, methane, black carbon, and other short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs). Unsustainable wood harvesting also contributes to loss of biodiversity and forest degradation, reducing carbon uptake by forests.\n",
      "Black carbon, which results from incomplete combustion, is estimated to contribute the equivalent of 25 to 50% of carbon dioxide warming globally, and residential solid fuel burning accounts for up to 25% of global black carbon emissions, about 84% of which is from households in developing countries. In South Asia, for example, more than half of black carbon comes from the use of inefficient cookstoves. \n",
      "When produced from sustainably managed woodlots, charcoal production can play a positive role in an agroforestry system. However, the unsustainable harvesting of wood for charcoal production can contribute to forest degradation. In some countries, the reliance on wood fuel – in the form of wood or wood charcoal - for cooking has led to a decline in the quality of forests. Degraded lands lead to losses in biodiversity, erosion control, and storm flow regulation (flood protection). Forest degradation contributes to climate change and can also lead to desertification.  \n",
      "Many of today’s more efficient cookstoves have been shown to reduce fuel use by 30-60%, resulting in fewer greenhouse gas and black carbon emissions and reducing impacts on forests, habitats, and biodiversity. Recent evidence also demonstrates that advanced (efficient and low emission) cookstoves and fuels can reduce black carbon emissions by 50-90%. Since the atmospheric lifetime of black carbon is only a few days, reducing black carbon emissions can bring about a more rapid climate response than reductions in carbon dioxide and other long-lived greenhouse gases alone. In addition to having an immediate impact on the climate, reducing black carbon emissions would have a regional effect.\n",
      "Studies show that controlling both short-lived climate pollutants and long-lived greenhouse gases can increase the chances of limiting global temperature rise to below 2ºC, a long-term international goal for avoiding the most dangerous impacts of climate change.\n",

      "During Phase 1, the Alliance and its partners helped over 20 million households adopt cleaner and more efficient cookstoves and fuels. These clean cooking solutions have helped save tens of thousands of lives, protected millions of trees in vulnerable ecosystems, and created hundreds of thousands of jobs.\n",
      "\n",
      "   \n",
      "While Phase 1 of the Alliance was dedicated to launching global and in-country efforts to rapidly grow the sector, Phase 2 focuses on driving investments, innovation, and operations to scale, with an ambitious goal of enabling 60 million households to adopt clean cooking solutions by 2017.  In addition to emphasizing scale, Phase 2 also marks a significant shift towards demand creation, while continuing to the Alliance’s work to strengthen supply and foster the enabling environment for clean cooking solutions. Toward this goal, the Alliance is working to better understand the cookstove and fuel needs of consumers, and to leverage this understanding to launch targeted awareness-raising campaigns in our focus countries and at the international level in order to drive demand for cleaner cooking solutions.  \n",
      "The Alliance is working with financial institutions and others stakeholders to make these cleaner solutions more affordable to consumers at the base of the pyramid by facilitating guarantees and new consumer financing products and delivery models. And we are also working to increase accessibility of clean cookstoves and fuels by strengthening existing last-mile distribution channels and leveraging new ones by funding pilots, building capacity for enterprises, and compiling and sharing best-practices.  The Alliance is also spurring efforts to  increase the integration of women in the clean cookstove value chain by empowering them to be clean cookstove and fuel entrepreneurs, and providing training and financing through the Women’s Empowerment Fund for the development of sustainable enterprises.   \n",
      " \n",
      "As demand for clean cookstoves and fuels grows, supply will need to keep pace to ensure consumers are able to purchase the products they want and need.  The Alliance will continue to engage in a graduated approach to provide and drive private investment and direct enterprise capacity-building, with support mechanisms ranging from early stage grant funding, through subsidized capital, to angel equity, and ultimately commercial capital.  \n",
      "Our Phase 2 efforts also reflect a continued emphasis on promoting technology innovation for increased stove and fuel performance and benefits via our leadership in the ongoing ISO process to create a set of standards for the sector to ensure that technologies achieve the desired benefits for health, livelihoods, and the environment.  The Alliance will also ramp up efforts to roll-out certification and labeling in our focus countries to ensure adherence to global standards and allow consumers to make informed choices.  \n",
      "We continue to support robust global research demonstrating the negative health, environmental and gender impacts from the use of solid fuels in open fires and traditional cookstove, and the net benefits of cleaner and more efficient cooking options in order to drive greater investment in the sector.\n",

      "In 2011, the Alliance released a comprehensive sector strategy in its groundbreaking report Igniting Change: A Strategy for Universal Adoption of Clean Cookstoves and Fuels. The subsequent three-phase Alliance strategic business plan provides a clear roadmap for the creation of a dynamic market for clean cooking solutions.  Thanks to the energy and commitment of its dedicated partners, donors, and supporters, the Initiative has surpassed many of its original goals. Here, in brief, are a few of the Alliance’s major achievements to date.\n",
      "The Alliance has grown from a handful of initial partners at our launch to over 1,600 global partners.  As of January 2015, we work with 51 national governments, 12 UN agencies, hundreds of entrepreneurs, enterprises, and NGOs, dozens of investors, and scores of foundations.   Our multisector appeal and proven market-driven approach have also brought a wealth of new players to the table including global corporations, financial institutions, bilateral donors, civil society groups, and f entrepreneurs and enterprises looking to build capacity, scale production, and improve their technologies and fuels to deliver health and environmental benefits to those at the base of the pyramid.  Researchers across several disciplines, including climate, gender, public health, and public policy are incorporating cookstoves and fuels elements into their studies. The Alliance has worked to support national and regional alliances in Africa, Asia, and Central America that are essential to our critical clean cooking mission.\n",
      "The Alliance established the Spark Fund, Women’s Empowerment Fund, Catalytic Small Grants Fund, and the Pilot Innovation Fund in order to support the development of commercially viable enterprises and encourage innovations in design, manufacturing, and distribution of clean cookstoves and fuels.  Using these grants and other forms of soft and patient capital, the Alliance has developed a robust pipeline of opportunities for investment and has mobilized significant investor interest in the sector, most notably a $100 million commitment from Bank of America, USAID, Deutsche Bank, and others to support investment in the sector in Phase 2. The Alliance also continues to create revenue streams for clean cooking enterprises by enhancing the demand for and access to carbon credits through our Carbon Finance Platform for clean cooking.\n",
      "During Phase 1, the Alliance and our global partners have driven $62 million in grant funding for Secretariat activities and another $50 million in investment for the sector at large. \n",
      "The Alliance, in collaboration with national standards committees and relevant organizations from 23 countries, has supported International Organization of Standardization Technical Committee 285 (ISO TC285), the first standards for cleaner and more efficient cookstoves and clean cooking solutions. The Alliance is also increasing local capacity in design innovation and testing by supporting 13 Regional Testing and Knowledge Centers (RTKCs) across Africa, Asia, and Latin America, and coordinating knowledge training and staff development within a broader network of RTKCs.  In addition, the Alliance has produced the Clean Cooking Catalog, an online database of stove and fuel performance, including information on stove features, design specifications, emissions levels, efficiency, and safety from both laboratory and field-testing.\n",
      "To save lives and mitigate the environmental impacts of black carbon and deforestation, the Alliance is also working to expand the role of cleaner and renewable fuels.  Central to our work are efforts to improve access, availability, and affordability of electricity, LPG, ethanol, methanol, biogas and solar for cooking.  The Alliance has commissioned research to identify barriers across the clean fuel supply chain, supported capacity building of clean fuel enterprises, increased the number of investors and resources to support scale and adoption of clean fuels in priority markets, and developed mechanisms to share best practices.\n",
      "The Alliance recognizes that women largely determine the use and adoption of clean cooking solutions and is documenting the impact women can have on adoption when they are engaged as entrepreneurs in the value chain. Working with our partners, the Alliance is testing the most effective gender-informed business models for scaling adoption and is providing targeted capacity building, training, and other tools to help partners address gender issues and integrate women into the clean cooking sector.  In addition, the Alliance launched the Women’s Empowerment Fund to provide financing for our partners to test new ways to empower women, and we are also funding innovative approaches to gender integration.\n",
      "The Alliance has seen tremendous momentum in its focus countries of Bangladesh, China, Ghana, Guatemala, India, Kenya, Nigeria and Uganda since 2010. Government leaders have built clean cooking solutions into their health, energy, and environmental policies and programs, investors have included clean cooking projects into their lending and investment portfolios, and in-country stakeholders have worked closely with the Alliance to develop and execute comprehensive National Action Plans.  The Alliance has also expanded and enriched its base of knowledge on the sector through twenty national market assessments, five customer segmentation studies, webinars, and informative reports that add to the sector’s understanding of the potential of clean cookstoves to help drive future expansion of the industry. The Alliance has also hosted international, regional, and national convenings including the 2013 Biennial Clean Cooking Forum in Phnom Penh, Cambodia that brought 500+ participants from 60 countries together for the largest gathering to date of sector stakeholders, and the 2014 Cookstoves Futures Summit in New York that raised over $400 million in grants and investments for the sector.\n",
      "The Alliance has invested more than $5 million in competitive research grants to support 39 studies across 23 countries.  We have formed a Research Advisory Committee of leading experts across different disciplines and helped build the evidence base for clean cookstoves and fuels thorough support for studies on child survival, climate change, clean fuels, women’s empowerment, and cookstoves and fuels markets. In addition, the Alliance has worked to share that knowledge with a broader network of advocates and stakeholders by hosting webinars and creating partner country toolkits that outline best practices and strategies for driving progress in the sector, as well as working with the World Health Organization on the development and roll-out of the Indoor Air Quality Guidelines. The Alliance’s Global Research Platform also works to convene researchers, commission research, and communicate results on the impacts of clean cooking solutions.\n",
      "The Alliance has been featured in hundreds of global, national, and local media outlets and has mobilized experts and influencers to highlight the urgency of the household air pollution issue and raise awareness of clean cooking solutions among policy-makers, donors, the private sector, and civil society.  The Alliance’s ambassadors, champions, and Leadership and Advisory Council members include a diverse group of world leaders, celebrities, executives, and other experts who are involved in advocacy and strategic guidance, fundraising, and media campaigns for the Alliance.  Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has played an invaluable role as a champion for the issue, leading the Alliance’s launch and early diplomatic outreach efforts, and currently serves as honorary chair of the Leadership Council.   The Alliance’s Chef Corps, comprised of well-known international culinary ambassadors who are passionate about reducing household air pollution, provides support for our efforts at the global level as well as in the Corp member’s respective countries.\n"

Because the fuel supply chain touches so many environmental, economic, social, and health issues, the impacts and opportunities are complex.  Our fuels strategy starts from understanding the challenges, benefits, and negative impacts of different fuel choices. This foundation then supports work to improve processing, distribution, and consumer awareness to create a sustainable and thriving market for fuels.\n",

      "Most of the food provided by humanitarian agencies must be cooked before it can be eaten, but cookstoves and fuel are rarely provided. As a result, women and children must risk their safety, health, and sometimes their lives, to search for and collect firewood in order to cook food over smoky, polluting open fires. In many cases, displaced women walk for hours to find firewood and have to carry heavy loads back to camp, which puts them at risk for physical and sexual attack, dehydration, and physical injuries. At night, lack of access to lighting further increases women’s vulnerability when navigating camps to use latrines and other services.\n",
      "Women and children are also exposed to health risks, including respiratory infections from smoke produced by inefficient stoves and fuels such as firewood. Children who collect firewood, or accompany their mothers, cannot attend school. Many refugees sell or exchange a portion of their food rations in order to procure the firewood needed to cook the remaining food. Such coping mechanisms can have serious consequences including malnutrition.\n",
      "In situations where firewood is the main source of fuel, such as in sub-Saharan Africa, the competition for dwindling natural resources is a trigger for tension between refugees and host communities. The collection of firewood by refugees can cause deforestation and environmental degradation, which can be long lasting and difficult to reverse. It can also lead to a ban on firewood collection, which prevents refugees from cooking their food and leads to devastating consequences for their nutrition.\n",
      "Ensuring access to cookstoves and fuels for vulnerable populations has been a component of the Alliance strategy since its launch. Refugees, IDPs, and other crisis-affected populations often can’t afford to purchase clean cookstoves and fuel, yet they suffer disproportionately from the consequences of lack of access to cooking technologies and fuel.\n",
      "The Alliance’s expert Humanitarian Working Group recommended that the Alliance’s strategy build on the work of the Safe Access to Fuel and Energy (SAFE) Steering Committee (formerly the IASC SAFE Task Force), a consortium of humanitarian organizations whose mission is to facilitate a more coordinated, predictable, timely, and effective response to the fuel and energy needs of crisis-affected populations.\n",
      "Today, the Alliance co-chairs the SAFE Steering Committee and coordinates the group’s global activities. The SAFE Steering Committee members, including UNHCR, WFP, UNICEF, FAO, and WRC among others, crisis-affected populations are able to satisfy their fuel and energy needs for cooking, heating, lighting, and powering in a safe and sustainable manner, without fear or risk to their health, well-being, and personal security.\n",
      "The Alliance’s internal humanitarian strategy contributes directly to the vision, mission, and global strategy outlined by the SAFE Steering Committee. The Alliance’s humanitarian engagement falls into six strategic pillars and will take place globally, as well as in SAFE focus countries:\n",
      "Safe and reliable access to energy for cooking, lighting, and powering is a basic need. Creating programs to improve Safe Access to Fuel and Energy (SAFE) saves lives and protects livelihoods in emergencies and crisis settings by integrating energy needs into emergency preparedness and response, improving access to household fuel and lighting using appropriate technologies and renewable energy, increasing access to energy for schools, health centers, and other institutions, and establishing and managing sustainable forestry resources for fuel provision and environmental protection.\n",

      "Testing helps people to evaluate, communicate, and ultimately improve the performance and quality of cookstoves and fuels. Without testing, consumers, retailers, humanitarian agencies, and governments would have no quantitative, rigorous, or consistent basis to evaluate technology options.  Testing provides an evidence-based understanding of performance and quality that can drive innovation to improve technologies over time, thus achieving greater impact and adoption. \n",
      "There are many protocols to test stoves and fuels, and many different metrics. Fuel consumption, efficiency, emissions, safety, and durability are evaluated in many test protocols. Most test protocols test stoves and fuels in combination.\n",
      "Any organization can perform stove testing, including manufacturers, research labs, and testing centers. However, testing can require extensive equipment and training, especially for emissions testing. Although any organization can conduct cookstove testing, care should be taken to ensure that the organization conducting the testing has the experience, knowledge, procedures, and equipment needed to collect and analyze accurate and quality data. A list of organizations that provide testing services is available on the Alliance website. Inclusion in this list is not an endorsement from the Alliance. Each organization has different capabilities, services, and prices, and should be contacted directly for more information.\n",
      "Both laboratory and field testing are essential components of the testing process, and each have tradeoffs. Lab testing provides results under controlled conditions, which can be used for comparing different models or as the basis for certification. Lab results can also be used to evaluate the impact of design modifications. Lab results, however, often differ from field results. To characterize potential impacts, stoves must be tested under actual, real-use conditions. Field testing evaluates performance under a range of context specific conditions, including variations in cooking styles and local cuisines. These tests can also evaluate whether users’ needs are addressed, giving an indication of consumer preferences. Lab and field testing are complementary and together can provide a comprehensive assessment.\n",
      "Individual protocols have different uses and limitations. Protocols should include guidance on appropriate application, interpretation of results, and limitations. Evaluation of stoves and fuels requires careful consideration of available protocols to ensure that the appropriate one is selected, and results are interpreted correctly. You should ask the questions “Is this protocol appropriate for my testing goals?”, “Can this test answer my questions?”, and “Is this testing center capable of conducting these tests?”. Testers should include these considerations when reporting testing results.\n",
      "Determining the validity of testing results requires an understanding of sample size and statistical analysis methods. For accurate and thorough reporting of results, reports should include relevant statistics such as standard deviation, coefficient of variation, confidence interval, etc., in addition to averages or tier levels.\n",
      "There are many factors that can influence performance, including: fuel type and quality, cooking vessels, user behavior, stove operation, equipment maintenance and calibration, data analysis, testing protocol and interpretation, testing environment, and others. Some of these factors cannot be controlled (e.g., there is inherent variability of biomass combustion), and some of these factors must be appropriately accounted for in the data analysis (e.g., local boiling point).\n",
      "Different protocols require different levels of controlling the cooking system, testing environment, and operation, depending on whether the goal is to compare stoves or to assess the potential impacts. Many lab testing protocols require a higher degree of control for results to be valid and comparable. If these factors are not controlled for, either within a test or between tests, the same stove can appear to have very different performance. Regardless of which protocol is being used, testers should measure critical factors and report them along with the test metrics to provide context for a more accurate assessment.\n",
      "International Workshop Agreements are a streamlined process within the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) that can be a first step towards formal ISO standards. In February 2012, more than 90 stakeholders from 23 countries met for an ISO meeting that resulted in unanimous support among meeting participants for IWA 11:2012 Guidelines for Evaluating Cookstove Performance. The IWA tiers are interim international guidelines for stove performance and safety. The goal is to provide common and easy-to-understand ratings for governments, donors, investors, and consumers to make decisions about technology options.\n",
      "The IWA framework rates cookstoves on four indicators (efficiency, indoor emissions, total emissions, safety), each along 5 Tiers (0: lowest performing to 4: highest performing). For each indicator, the Tier boundaries are defined by quantitative values based on data from laboratory testing. The protocols that have been mapped to tiers are the Water Boiling Test 4.1.2 (WBT) and the Biomass Stove Safety Protocol 1.1, although the IWA framework was designed to accommodate other protocols.\n",
      "The WBT is one of the more common lab tests used to evaluate cookstove performance. It is a useful tool during the research & development process to understand the effect of various design options, to compare different designs with each other, to help identify products for field assessments, and to ensure design specifications have been met. The WBT does NOT assess stove performance under field conditions, and therefore cannot quantify the precise impact the cookstove will have in any specific community. Because of the higher resource requirement for field testing, lab testing is sometimes used as the basis for modeling field performance. Such an approach should be taken cautiously and transparently and include clear statement of limitations and assumptions. These models should be updated with field data when it is available.\n",
      "A number of specific questions about the WBT have been identified, including the applicability of the test sequence, the calculation of efficiency, the use of a lid on the pot, and the consideration of char. These and other issues are described in the WBT protocol, and should be considered when interpreting WBT test results. Similar limitations and issues should be considered when interpreting results from other existing test protocols.\n",
      "The IWA included a recommendation that new protocols be developed and/or current protocols updated. The Alliance and many others in the sector recognize the need for improvement. Experts have been working continuously over the last few years, through the ISO Technical Committee 285 (TC 285), to develop improved methods and standards. Protocols will be published as soon as they are complete. The ISO process minimizes bias by including any interested countries or experts in the process. The ISO process is also consensus-driven. TC 285 currently includes experts from 45 countries and 8 liaison organizations. Information on how to participate is available here.\n",
      "The Alliance supports both lab and field testing as both are important, complementary assessment tools. The Alliance references lab testing and the IWA guidelines for our definitions of “clean” and “efficient”, as lab testing is generally the basis of standards. After updated lab testing protocols and tiers are published, the Alliance will reassess our definitions of “clean” and “efficient” to ensure they reflect the latest international consensus on stove and fuel performance.\n",
      "The Alliance is technology and fuel neutral. We understand that there are a multitude of needs and preferences that vary from country to country, and even household to household. Our goal is to support the development of cookstoves and fuels markets comprised of cleaner and more efficient options that are accessible to everyone. We do not define entire categories of stoves and fuels as clean or efficient, as performance is variable even within categories. Instead, the Alliance focuses on the performance of each stove and/or fuel; our definitions of clean and efficient are based on proven emissions and efficiency. Any stove or fuel can be designated as clean or efficient as long as performance standards are met.\n"

      "The evidence is robust and compelling: exposure to household air pollution (HAP) is responsible for a staggering number of preventable illnesses and deaths each year. According to the most recent estimates published in The Lancet in 2017, approximately 2.6 million deaths can be attributed to HAP each year. This figure has evolved significantly over the past decade. The first global burden of disease estimates in the early 2000s suggested that approximately 2 million premature deaths occur each year as a result of exposure to indoor air pollution (IAP). Since then, updated estimates published between 2012 and 2016 attributed between 2.9 to 4.3 million deaths to direct exposure to household air pollution. Starting in 2016, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) has committed to updating estimates on an annual basis. This briefing note provides a brief description of the various factors that drive changes in estimates over time.\n",
      "For the most up-to-date country specific information on burden of disease and trends, visit www.healthdata.org\n",
      "No. Around 3 billion people continue to cook with traditional stoves and fuels. Taking population trends into account, this translates into around half of the world’s population in 2000 and approximately 40% of the world population today. While the relative proportion of people exposed to this risk has decreased, the absolute number of people at risk has not changed.\n",
      "Yes. Changes in specific burdens of disease can have a positive or negative effect on risk factor-specific burdens. The implementation of new prevention, diagnostic, and treatment strategies can have major impacts on cause-specific burdens of disease, which can then impact risk factor-specific burdens. For example, with major declines in childhood pneumonia observed over time, there is a smaller pool of pneumonia that can be prevented by scaling clean cooking. On the other hand, with increasing prevalence of noncommunicable diseases, including chronic lung and cardiovascular disease, the public health relevance of scaling clean cooking to promote the health of elderly populations will only continue to increase. \n",
      "Changes in the risk assessment methodology can result in increases or decreases in burden of disease estimates. Each time IHME updates their methods and/or estimates, they also use the same methodology to recalculate previous years’ data to allow for a direct comparison of changes in burden over time. \n",

      "Three billion people, or 40% of the world population, rely on traditional use of biomass for cooking. The rural poor, mostly women, largely only have access to fuels that are inefficient in converting to energy. Lack of access to cooking fuel forces women and children to spend many hours gathering fuel - up to 5 hours per day- or spend significant household income purchasing fuel. In some cases, women provide 91% of households’ total efforts in collecting fuel and water, and women have an average working day of 11-14 hours, compared to 10 hours on average for men. A reduction in time spent collecting fuel and cooking enables women to spend more time with their children, tend to other responsibilities, enhance existing economic opportunities, pursue income-generating or educational opportunities and leisure activities and rest – all of which contribute to poverty alleviation.\n",
      "Women play a crucial role in the widespread adoption and use of clean household cooking solutions because of their central responsibility for managing household energy and cooking. As consumers and users of cookstoves, women are not just victims but a critical component of the sector’s ability to scale. Women must be fully integrated into the process of designing products and solutions because without their opinions and input, products will not meet their needs and will not be used.\n",
      "The Alliance has a strategy to increase the role of women and address gender issues to scale adoption. Gender-informed practices help enterprises understand the impact of gender dynamics on their business, and help cooking sector players leverage opportunities to empower women and promote gender equality. The major challenges to scaling women’s empowerment and entrepreneurship include: the lack of capacity of enterprises to address gender; financing for gender components in projects; evidence of gender impacts in the sector; and the need to influence policies through awareness-raising and advocacy. The Alliance is addressing these challenges through research, training, development of tools, grant opportunities, national awareness campaigns, and high-level engagement with the energy sector and gender experts.\n",

      "Held in Kenya, the workshop was a unique opportunity for energy and humanitarian stakeholders to connect in-person and build capacity to implement effective energy solutions in humanitarian contexts. The workshop, which featured three days of classroom learning, panel discussions, and interactive sessions on topics including financing and the emerging role of the private sector, was hosted by the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves (the Alliance) in partnership with the United Nations Foundation (UNF), United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) Kenya, the International Organization for Migration (IOM), and the World Food Programme (WFP) with support from the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs and  Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad).\n",
      "On Day 4, the UN Foundation hosted a side event on the role of mini and micro grids in refugee camps.\n",
      "The first day of the workshop focused on conceptualizing the cross-cutting nature of SAFE, and the many ways that energy access – and a lack thereof – impacts crisis-affected people. The Alliance and Chatham House provided a “State of the Sector” overview identifying challenges and gaps currently facing SAFE practitioners, as well as opportunities for increased engagement thanks to the advent of Sustainable Development Goal 7 and the Agenda for Humanity.\n",

      "Since 2010 the groundwork has been laid for a thriving global market for cleaner and more efficient cookstoves and fuels. Still, many barriers remain, in particular on the demand side related to awareness, availability, affordability, and sustained adoption of cleaner cooking options.\n",
      " \n",
      "Little awareness exists among affected populations of both the negative impacts of using inefficient stoves and the availability of clean cooking solutions.  Many of these households are located in rural or remote areas, beyond the reach of many distribution channels. This logistical challenge is compounded by questions about affordability and inability, or consumers’ unwillingness to pay for an unfamiliar product that might not meet their  needs.  Once a cookstove or fuel has been purchased, its use needs to become a regular and consistent part of the user’s behavior to ensure that all the benefits are realized.\n",
      " \n",
      "The Alliance and its partners are working to address these barriers by engaging in a six step process to generate demand and ensure ongoing and near exclusive use.\n",
      "Our customer and market research from Phase 1 will now enable targeted  awareness raising campaigns in each of its focus countries. These public-facing activities spread the message about the benefits of cleaner stoves and fuels and showcase available technologies.  The campaigns take a layered, multi-level approach and involve social marketing through such channels as radio, billboards and mobile messaging. Roadshows are part of the mix for product demonstrations and grassroots outreach, together with consumer education carried out by community health workers, women and faith-based groups, local opinion leaders, schools, and other social groups.\n",
      "The Alliance’s awareness-raising campaigns are complemented by efforts to make cleaner cooking solutions more affordable and accessible, including technical and financial interventions around distribution and consumer financing.  As more options for financing and retail distribution points become available, this information will be incorporated into messaging. Further, as demand and interest for clean cookstoves and fuels grows, men and women will have clear, actionable information about where to get a stove and how they can finance it.  On the ground local change agents who reside within these communities will also support these outreach efforts and help facilitate the behavior change that is necessary for consumers to embrace a new product.\n",

      "NAIROBI, KENYA –  Families across Kenya will soon learn about clean cooking on their TVs and radios, thanks to a new series titled Shamba Chef.  Premiering on September 17, Shamba Chef will take viewers inside Kenyan homes, to watch as families learn how to prepare more nutritious meals while testing out a new stove or fuel that makes cooking “quicker, safer, cleaner, and at half the cost.” \n",
      "The weekly series will air in both English and Swahili on Citizen TV, Kenya’s most popular TV station, and each episode will be adapted for a weekly radio series. A free mobile based platform called iChef will give subscribers access to additional content, including nutritious recipes and cooking tips. \n",
      "In Kenya, eight out of ten people cook with heavily-polluting solid fuels like wood and charcoal, causing widespread environmental and health impacts that disproportionally affect women and children.  Many cleaner cooking options exist in Kenya, from improved charcoal stoves to clean burning fuels like LPG, yet many people are not aware of these options or have not prioritized them.\n",
      "Shamba Chef was created with support from the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves, as part of its effort to use communication to motivate households to purchase and adopt cleaner cooking solutions.  Content for the series was developed in collaboration with the Alliance’s partners in Kenya.\n",
      "“Based on our research, we know that over 80% of the targeted population regularly watch television and listen to the radio. This means a program like Shamba Chef can be a powerful delivery system for information and ultimately, to inspire people to switch to cleaner cookstoves and fuels.” said Julie Ipe, Senior Manager of Market Insight & Behavior Change at the Alliance.\n",
      "The series is produced by the Mediae Company, an award-winning producer of entertaining and educational media that promote changes in knowledge, attitudes, and practices amongst East African audiences.  Mediae produces several other popular shows in Kenya, including East Africa’s leading agricultural TV program, Shamba Shape Up, which is now in its 7th season and reaches up to 3 million viewers weekly. An assessment of the most recent season of Shamba Shape Up found that 80% of viewers reported learning something new, and 43% - equaling an estimated 2 million people across Kenya - made changes to their farming practices as a result of watching the show.  Clean cooking is also being featured on 10 episodes of Shamba Shape Up.\n",
      "Shamba Chef is complemented by an Alliance-supported community outreach intervention, led by PS Kenya in 17 counties in Central and Western Kenya.  PS Kenya is working with community-based organizations to conduct door to door and small group communication on the benefits of clean cooking, as well as market events and cooking demonstrations. Mediae and PS Kenya were awarded support via the Alliance’s Clean Cooking BCC Fund—a portfolio of grants aimed at scaling demand and use of clean cooking solutions. The interventions supported under the BCC Fund are externally evaluated to measure their impact on behavioral change related to clean cooking. Additional BCC-related resources, materials, and tools for anyone designing, implementing, and/or evaluating behavior change communication activities can be found on the BCC Resource Hub.\n",

The Alliance’s 100 by ’20 goal calls for 100 million households to adopt cleaner and more efficient cookstoves and fuels by 2020. The Alliance is working with its public, private and non-profit partners to accelerate the production, deployment, and use of clean cookstoves and fuels in developing countries.\n",

      "On Easter Sunday morning, in the small town of San Antonio Aguas Calientes in central Guatemala, Elbia Pérez and her sister, daughters, and 18-month-old grandson are crowded around their kitchen table. On the table, a large pot of tamales, handfuls of spicy meat and corn dough wrapped in plantain leaves, stands waiting to be steamed. The room is filled with talk, laughter, and smoke—gritty, eye-watering smoke that sticks in the throat and provokes deep, scratchy coughs.\n",
      "The problem isn’t that the family lacks a functioning stove. In fact the aluminum-sided kitchen—part of a compound that shelters 45 extended-family members—contains three. But the two-burner gas stove is out of fuel, and the Pérez family can’t afford to fill it. Their efficient woodstove, a knee-high concrete cylinder donated by an aid group called StoveTeam International, is too small to support the tamale pot. So, as she does about once a month, Perez has fired up the old wood-burning stove, a crumbling, chimney-less brick ruin whose smoke pours directly into the unventilated kitchen. Everyone notices the smoke, but it’s a familiar annoyance—and compared with the daily challenge of affording food and fuel, it’s a minor one.\n",
      "Some three billion people around the world cook their food and heat their homes with open or barely contained fires, and while the smoke dissipates quickly, its accumulated costs are steep. The typical cooking fire produces about 400 cigarettes’ worth of smoke an hour, and prolonged exposure is associated with respiratory infections, eye damage, heart and lung disease, and lung cancer. In the developing world, health problems from smoke inhalation are a significant cause of death in both children under five and women. “The first thing we swallowed every morning was smoke,” remembers Marco Tulio Guerra, who grew up in rural eastern Guatemala and whose brother was severely burned as a child by the family cooking fire. To fuel the smoky fires, families can spend 20 hours a week or more gathering wood, time that might otherwise be spent at school, at work, or simply at rest.\n",
      "Wood-burning household fires and inefficient stoves cause broader suffering, too. The firewood trade promotes deforestation and also provides cover for timber smuggling, since wood from rare trees can be hidden among logs from more common species. The smoke from cook fires pollutes the air outdoors as well as indoors, especially in cities. And as a major source of black carbon—a sunlight-absorbing pollutant—the world’s billions of household fires are also thought to be accelerating the effects of climate change, speeding the disruption of monsoon cycles and the melting of glaciers.\n",
      "In the 1970s, a major earthquake in Guatemala brought international aid groups to the country, where they learned about the health and environmental costs of open cooking fires. Since then, a diffuse network of engineers and philanthropists has invented and distributed hundreds of different kinds of improved stoves throughout the developing world, ranging from tiny, gas-powered camping stoves to wood-fired ranges large enough to feed a dozen. Thanks to an initial investment by StoveTeam International, Guerra now owns a factory in central Guatemala—one of several similar operations in Mexico and Central America—that manufactures eight types of improved cookstoves, and he sells them to both aid groups and individuals throughout the country. His very first stove, which he built by hand almost a decade ago, is still in daily use nearby, in Rosa de Sapeta’s kitchen. De Sapeta says that her family used to avoid the smoke-filled kitchen, but now, she says, “I have company when I cook.”\n",
      "New cookstoves aren’t always adopted so easily and enthusiastically, however. For a stove to be fully accepted by a household, both stove and fuel must be affordable, accessible, and easy to use—goals that aren’t easy to achieve simultaneously, as the Pérez family has found. And in places where the social status of women is still tightly tied to the quality of their cooking, woe to the stove whose output doesn’t measure up to local culinary standards. “When I started this work, I thought it was just a matter of choices and appliances,” says Radha Muthiah, the chief executive officer of the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves, which was founded in 2010 and is hosted by the United Nations Foundation, with support from public and private funds. “But as you get into it, you realize there are so many different considerations.” Muthiah and other stove experts emphasize that there is no single ideal stove or ideal fuel, as every household, every community, and every culture has different needs and priorities: a stove designed for rural Guatemala may well be completely impractical in Nairobi.\n",
      "To make it possible for each family to choose its own ideal stove, the Alliance recently provided start-up funding to two retail stores in Guatemala. Called Estufas Mejoradas y Mas— “Better Stoves and More”—the stores are run by local women, and they stock gas and wood-burning stoves of all sizes. Prospective customers can try out the stoves before choosing one, making tortillas from dough supplied by the stores.\n",

The Alliance is developing clear and transparent indicators that can cost-effectively measure results from the most basic project parameters like cookstove sales, adoption rates, household air pollution, fuel collection time, and fuel savings, to broader objectives regarding saving lives, empowering women, improving livelihoods, and protecting the environment. These efforts must be applicable to all geographies and target markets as well as to the majority of cookstove and fuel distribution efforts.\n",
      "The Alliance's objective is to measure progress and success toward our goals while simultaneously addressing evidence gaps and facilitating improvements in the sector over time. Thus, standards, testing and research all play integral roles in the Alliance’s approach to M&E, particularly as we track the distribution and adoption of stoves at different ‘tiers’ of performance with respect to efficiency, safety, and emissions.\n",
      "The results framework can be roughly divided into three sections, and includes both measured and modeled indicators.  The Alliance's M&E system utilizes a mix of population based surveys, results reporting, routine reporting from grantees, evaluation studies and impact assessment to track progress on market development, clean cooking distribution, clean cooking adoption and use, mission goals (health, environment, gender, and livelihood impacts), the impact of public awareness campaigns, and achievement of the Alliance's value propositions.  \n"

      "What do the Tiers mean:  The IWA framework rates cookstoves on four (4) indicators (efficiency, indoor emissions, total emissions, safety), each along 5 Tiers (0: lowest performing to 4: highest performing).  For each indicator, the Tiers boundaries are defined by quantitative values determined by laboratory testing.  The protocol that has been mapped to tiers is the Water Boiling Test 4.2.3 and the Biomass Stove Safety Protocol 1.1, although the IWA framework was designed to accommodate other protocols.\n",

      "Cooking smoke contributes to a range of chronic illnesses and acute health impacts such as early childhood pneumonia, emphysema, cataracts, lung cancer, bronchitis, cardiovascular disease, and low birth weight. Women and young children are the most affected, with more than 100,000 children in India dying every year as a result of acute lower respiratory infections caused by the use of solid fuels. \n",
      "Sixty-four percent of India’s population relies on solid fuel for their household cooking needs. Reliance on biomass for cooking and heating leads to environmental degradation through increased pressure on local natural resources, and forces women and children to spend many hours each week collecting wood. Inefficient cooking also contributes to climate change through emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane, and aerosols such as black carbon.\n",
      "India is home to some of the world’s most polluted cities, and Alliance-funded research shows that household air pollution is a major contributor. By evaluating the impact of household energy consumption on 640 districts across India, researchers found that almost 30% of the country’s outdoor air pollution is due to household energy combustion. In some districts, household air pollution contributes up to 50% of outdoor air pollution, making a clear case that reducing outdoor air pollution requires addressing air pollution at the household level as well.\n",

      "Sustained adoption of clean and efficient cookstoves is essential for developing countries in reducing adverse health, environmental and climate impacts. Numerous factors influence a family’s decision to adopt a new cookstove or fuel including socioeconomic, behavioral, and environmental. While a range of benefits can be achieved through the adoption of clean cookstoves and fuels, experience in community development has shown that improved technologies or cleaner fuels do not guarantee usage.  Households are reluctant to adopt technologies or fuels that are:\n",
      "Although social and environmental benefits can be achieved through the adoption of clean cookstoves and fuels, dramatic reductions in emissions are required to achieve health benefits. Indeed, recent research suggests that substantial health benefits can only be achieved with intensive, near exclusive adoption of extremely low emission technologies and fuels.\n",
      "A gendered approach is critical for adoption and sustained use of clean cooking solutions, and while better understanding of women’s needs and their involvement in technology development and implementation are vitally important, so too is greater involvement of men. This is because men often play an important role in decisions regarding the household budget. Furthermore, men are sometimes involved in the gathering of biomass and therefore are the main beneficiaries of the fuel savings.\n"

      "Beyond dire health impacts, the inefficiency of this cooking method consumes hours of women’s time each day. It even has implications on sexual violence, as women and girls often must travel dangerous distances alone to collect fuel for cooking.

      "Gold Standard-certified projects are required to contribute positively to climate protection plus two additional development benefits. For years, projects that deliver clean and efficient cooking solutions to communities have tackled many of these social, economic, and environmental challenges. These efforts have helped lower household spending on fuel, minimize women’s ‘drudgery’ or the many hours spent on unpaid work like fuel collection and long cooking times, and reduce their exposure to deadly fumes.  \n",
      "Now with clearly defined SDG 5 indicators and more evidence of the transformative potential for women’s empowerment to fight climate change and achieve other development goals, Gold Standard’s Gender Equality Framework takes this to the next level.\n",

      "By quantifying and certifying gender impacts, projects can tap into additional funding from an increasing pool of gender-lens investors and a rising demand to credibly report on what dollars have delivered. The Gold Standard Gender Equality Framework is flexible and indicators can be selected according to what funders or projects priorities. \n",
      "This gender-disaggregated impact data can also be used to track progress at a regional or national level, helping policymakers to develop effective evidence-based policies and enabling tracking of progress toward the SDGs in initiatives like the Global Partnership for SDGs.\n",
      "What’s clear is that gender issues are complex, but addressing them can be transformative. Indeed, closing gender gaps can accelerate progress towards many other Sustainable Development Goals.\n",
      "Conversely, poverty, education, health, jobs and livelihoods, food security, environmental and energy sustainability will not be solved without addressing gender inequality. If we’re serious about the bold ambition of ‘gender equality for all’, we first need to know how we’re doing in the race to 2030 and, critically, get the most out of every development dollar we spend.\n",
      "The Gold Standard Gender Equality Framework was developed with support from the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg Ministry of Sustainable Development and Infrastructure – Department of Environment. Organizations looking to help empower women and girls can support projects making a measurable difference in gender equality by funding Gold Standard Certified SDG 5 Impacts. Find out more here.

      "Daily exposure to toxic smoke from traditional cooking practices is one of the world’s biggest – but least well-known killers. Penetrating deep into the lungs of its victims, this acrid smoke causes a range of deadly chronic and acute health effects such as child pneumonia, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and heart disease, as well as low birth-weights in children born to mothers whose pregnancies are spent breathing toxic fumes from traditional cookstoves. The evidence is robust and compelling: exposure to household air pollution (HAP) is responsible for a staggering number of preventable illnesses and deaths each year.  Indeed, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that exposure to smoke from the simple act of cooking constitutes the fourth leading risk factor for disease in developing countries, and causes over 4 million premature deaths per year – exceeding deaths attributable to malaria or tuberculosis. In addition, tens of millions more fall sick with illnesses that could readily be prevented with improved adoption of clean and efficient cookstoves and fuels.\n",
      "Exposure to these toxic fumes is greatest among women and young children, who spend a disproportionate amount of time near open fires or traditional cookstoves tending to the family meal, or schoolchildren who may study by the weak light of an open flame. Typical wood-fired cookstoves and open fires emit small particles, carbon monoxide, and other noxious fumes that are up to 100 times higher than the recommended limits set by WHO, and in some settings, considerably higher.\n",
      "The illnesses caused by smoke exposure from toxic cooking methods lead to serious problems for the health and livelihoods of these families, hampering their ability to escape grinding poverty. Women in developing countries are at risk of head and spinal injuries, and pregnancy complications from the strenuous task of carrying heavy loads of firewood or other fuels, and may also suffer from gender-based violence, animal attacks, dehydration, and skin disorders. Frequent exposure to cookstove smoke can also cause disabling health impacts like cataracts, and is the leading cause of blindness in developing countries. Health effects are especially deadly for children under the age of five in developing countries: nearly half of all pneumonia deaths among this age group occur as a result of smoke exposure.\n",
      "Burns from open fires and unsafe cookstoves are another insidious risk faced by poor households dependent on kerosene, open fires, and unstable metal or clay cookstoves, contributing to a substantial percentage of the estimated 195,000 burn deaths that occur annually. Because burns require prompt and sophisticated medical intervention often lacking in remote areas of the world, such injuries often result in debilitating scarring and loss of movement in their victims.\n",
      "While a range of social and environmental benefits can be achieved through the adoption of clean cookstoves and fuels, research evidence focused on children’s pneumonia suggests that dramatic reductions in exposures are required to achieve health benefits. As a result, substantial health benefits can likely only be achieved with intensive, near exclusive adoption of extremely low emission technologies.\n",
      "The sustained use of clean cookstoves and fuels can dramatically reduce smoke emissions, and resulting exposure, which can reduce the burden of disease associated with household air pollution.\n",

      "A recent study from North Carolina State University finds that advanced wood-burning stoves designed for use in the developing world can reduce air pollution more than anticipated, because gaseous emissions from traditional wood stoves form more particulate matter in the atmosphere than researchers previously thought.\n",
      "\"Previous studies have looked solely at direct emissions from cookstoves,\" says Andrew Grieshop, an assistant professor of civil, construction and environmental engineering at NC State and corresponding author of a paper describing the work. \"We've now done a series of experiments to determine what happens to those emissions while they are in the atmosphere.\"\n",
      "At issue is particulate matter (PM): minute, airborne particles that can contribute to human health problems, such as asthma.\n",
      "For this study, researchers tested three types of wood-burning stoves: traditional stoves; natural-draft stoves; and forced-draft stoves, which use battery-powered fans to improve combustion. The researchers collected emissions from each of the stoves and used an environmental chamber and a custom-built oxidation flow reactor to mimic the chemical reactions that would normally take place with the emissions over the course of up to two weeks in the atmosphere.\n",
      "The researchers found that, while traditional stoves emitted an average of 6 grams of PM per kilogram of fuel burned (g/kg), that number jumps to an average of 14 g/kg when you include the PM that the emissions form over time, due to chemical reactions that take place in the atmosphere.\n",
      "Natural-draft stoves, by comparison, produced an average of about 4 g/kg of PM - even after aging in the atmosphere. And forced-draft stoves produced less than 3 g/kg.\n",
      "\"All of this is based on lab measurements, which is important to note because previous studies have found that advanced stoves don't necessarily work as well in the field as they do in the lab,\" Grieshop says. \"However, the study does tell us that looking solely at stove emissions at the point of use doesn't give us a full picture of what's going on. The effects of atmospheric chemistry are extremely important to understanding the potential air quality benefits.\"\n",
      "Advanced stoves are more efficient than traditional ones. So, for example, advanced stoves require less wood to boil a pot of water. However, kilogram of wood for kilogram of wood, advanced stoves produce PM that absorbs more light than PM from traditional stoves, which produce more reflective PM. Absorbing PM can make a large contribution to atmospheric warming, while reflective PM can offset it. \n",
      "\"There are a lot of variables involved when it comes to evaluating the effects of these emissions on global climate change, but it's an interesting finding that should be taken into consideration when modeling the effect of both traditional and advanced stove technologies on the climate,\" Grieshop says.\n",

      "Abstract: Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation during photo-oxidation of primary emissions from cookstoves used in developing countries may make important contributions to their climate and air quality impacts. We present results from laboratory experiments with a field portable oxidation flow reactor (F-OFR) to study the evolution of emissions over hours to weeks of equivalent atmospheric aging. Lab tests, using dry red oak, measured fresh and aged emissions from a 3 stone fire (TSF), a \"rocket\" natural draft stove (NDS) and a forced draft gasifier stove (FDGS), in order of increasing modified combustion efficiency (MCE) and decreasing particulate matter emission factors (EF). SOA production was observed for all stoves/tests; organic aerosol (OA) enhancement factor ranged from 1.2 to 3.1, decreasing with increased MCE. In primary emissions, OA mass spectral fragments associated with oxygenated species (primary biomass burning markers) increased (decreased) with MCE; fresh OA from FDGS combustion was especially oxygenated. OA oxygenation increased with further oxidation for all stove emissions, even where minimal enhancement was observed. More efficient stoves emit particles with greater net direct specific warming than TSFs, with the difference increasing with aging. Our results show that the properties and evolution of cookstove emissions are a strong function of combustion efficiency and atmospheric aging.\n",

      "The Alliance and partners are actively exploring fundamental principles of combustion and innovative design ideas through research and development (R&D) efforts.  The Alliance’s Pilot Innovation Fund identifies and funds innovative technologies with potential to scale.  PIF grantees drive disruptive change in technologies and fuels, with projects covering vacuum tube solar cookers, multi-fuel biomass stoves, and ethanol stoves.  The U.S. Department of Energy has supported a research portfolio that includes research on semi-gasifier cookstoves to be more robust to different conditions, developing combustion cores that can be incorporated into widely used stove types, durable materials, and improved auxiliary devices like thermoelectric generators.  Across all of these R&D efforts, laboratory design is integrated with field and user testing and improving manufacturing processes, to reach the goal of high performing technologies that will be affordable and meet user needs.\n",
      "Disseminating lessons from research organizations to the sector is required for successful commercialization and scale for these new innovations.  To address this challenge, the Alliance is also supporting technology transfer and capacity building, to extend the impact of ongoing research and development projects.\n",
      "Interventions and decisions focused on fuel supply and demand must be based on sound data and analysis.  Research to improve harvesting, processing or conversion, and distribution, as well as sharing the best practices learned from these studies, can help to scale up efficient practices with low environmental impacts and increased benefits for livelihoods.\n",
      "As part of a three-year strategic research initiative for climate benefits and reduce environmental degradation, the Alliance and partners are developing a database of wood fuel demand and use, as well as estimates of the fraction of non-renewable biomass (fNRB).  In places where deforestation is a concern, and where the collection of firewood contributes to negative environmental impacts, this information can be used to identify areas where scaling clean cookstoves and fuels could provide the greatest benefits to the environment.\n",
      "Environmental benefits will also be gained by removing barriers to processing and enhancing efficiency of global supply chains. The Alliance is performing an analysis across different fuel supply chains to evaluate social, economic and environmental impacts and strengthen the case for investors, and support decision-making for partners working in the fuels space.\n",
      "Enterprise-level innovations are also an area of focus, including innovations on fuel product design, performance, processing, marketing and distribution or business models.  The Alliance is also supporting analyses of life cycle impacts of enterprise fuel production and processing.  The results of these analyses help enterprises to communicate evidence of environmental benefits, build their capacity and plan for sustainable scale up of production.  The lessons learned are being shared to scale the best ideas across the sector.\n"

      "Cooking smoke contributes to a range of chronic illnesses and acute health impacts such as early childhood pneumonia, emphysema, cataracts, lung cancer, bronchitis, cardiovascular disease, and low birth weight. Women and young children are the most affected, with more than 5,000 children in Kenya dying every year as a result of acute lower respiratory infections caused by the smoke from the use of solid fuels. \n",
      "Eighty-four percent of Kenya’s population relies on solid fuel for their household cooking needs. Reliance on biomass for cooking and heating leads to environmental degradation from increased pressure on local natural resources, and forces women and children to spend many hours each week collecting wood. Inefficient cooking also contributes to climate change through emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane, and aerosols such as black carbon.\n",
      "The use of cleaner and more efficient cookstoves and fuels can dramatically reduce exposure to harmful cookstove smoke, can provide myriad economic opportunities for Kenyans, and can help reduce forest degradation and slow climate change. More efficient stoves and cleaner fuels also reduce the time people—usually women and girls—need to spend collecting fuel, freeing up time for income generating activities or schoolwork.\n",

      "The uptake of LPG in both rural and urban areas provides significant reduction of harmful climate forcing emissions, according to a recent study published by the Environmental Research Letters journal.\n",
      "As a consequence of both policies and socio-economic developments, researchers found that LPG access in urban India increased 17% and 5% in urban and rural regions, respectively, between 2001 and 2011. In “Environmental payoffs of LPG cooking in India,” researchers used data collected in that same time period to estimate the net emissions impacts and displaced fuelwood of the observed transition from traditional biomass cooking to LPG stoves. Taking into account both Kyoto [CO2 and CH4] and non-Kyoto [short-lived climate pollutants like black carbon] climate-active emissions, this increase in LPG access contributed to an estimated net emissions reduction of 6.73 megatons of CO2 equivalent (6.73 MtCO2e) and 7.2 million tons of displaced fuelwood in 2011. The study provides the first national level estimate of the emissions impacts from household level transition to clean fuels that accounts for fuel stacking and the renewability of fuelwood.\n",
      "This research emphasizes the importance of accounting for fuelwood renewability and considering the impacts of non-Kyoto climate pollutants to accurately measure the climate emissions as a result of transitioning to alternative fuels, and should be considered carefully in policy making and analysis. When also accounting for SLCPs, the study found an increase of the national net climate emissions reductions of 55% (3.05 MtCO2e vs.  6.73MtCO2e).\n",
      "“Even if we assume all fuelwood is renewable and count only the set of greenhouse gases included in the Kyoto Protocol [CO2 and CH4], which excludes short-lived emissions like black carbon, we find no net climate impact of this transition. This is because cooking with LPG is much more efficient, and burning wood emits methane—also a greenhouse gas,” says Deavyani Singh, the study’s lead author.\n",
      "Programs to provide alternative energy sources such as biogas for cooking have been shown to reduce pressure on forests from fuelwood collection, according to new research published online in the journal for Global Ecology & Conservation. In “Impact of biogas interventions on forest biomass and regeneration in southern India,” researchers report that forest plots near villages with biogas interventions had greater forest biomass than similar plots near villages without biogas.\n",
      "Using an existing intervention implemented in 2005, researchers tested whether increased biogas use in communities that previously harvested wood from nearby forests resulted in increased biomass, increased regeneration, and different species composition than comparable forests bordering villages where such an intervention did not take place. The results of the study showed increased biomass in forest plots near villages where more than 20% of households had biogas. These forests also contained more diversity of saplings, showing better long-term potential for regeneration.\n",
      "This study suggests that alternative fuel interventions can measurably cause higher biomass and regeneration in areas with forest impacts from fuelwood harvesting.  Solid ground support contributed greatly to the success of the biogas intervention. Researchers found that the biogas units were regularly used and well-maintained even after 10 years, indicating that positive forest changes can occur when alternative fuels are provided and used consistently. The researchers caution that biogas interventions that are poorly implemented, implemented under drought conditions, or in areas that are less degraded may not have the same results.\n",

      "Country participation in the Alliance has grown markedly in the Initiative’s first four years.  From an initial base of three donor countries and three national partners at our September 2010 launch, the Alliance now has more than 50 donor and implementing national partners. Government entities from this strong base of national stakeholders, are deeply committed to the development of a thriving market for clean, safe, and efficient cookstoves and fuels, both within their borders and regionally, and have made collaboration with the Alliance a national priority.  Further, these countries’ engagement forms the core of the Alliance’s efforts to develop sustainable and comprehensive local, national, and regional clean cooking policies and programs in keeping with our 10-Year Strategic Roadmap.\n",

      "After a thorough evaluation process in 2011, the Alliance prioritized six initial focus countries for immediate engagement during Phase I (2011–2014) including Bangladesh, China, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, and Uganda.  The Alliance selected Guatemala and India as additional focus countries in 2014, and additional countries may be named as focus countries in the future as resources allow.  The Alliance has worked closely with leading sector stakeholders in each of our eight focus countries to develop robust country action plans (CAPs) which identify intervention options, detail partner commitments, and highlight areas for potential Alliance and stakeholder engagement in each country.\n",
      "The Alliance continues to consult with and provide technical assistance, targeted resources, and partner toolkits to national stakeholders in partner countries such as Colombia, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Mexico, Nepal, Peru, Rwanda, and Tanzania.  In addition, with some exceptions, Alliance funding opportunities are open to qualified stakeholders operating in the broader range of Alliance partner countries, and we work with national counterparts, local alliances, and clean cooking stakeholders to develop a thriving market for clean cooking solutions.  \n",

      "Meet Mama Imade – a young, energetic, and industrious mother who recently moved to Lagos with her husband and two children to start a better life. Juggling the demands of city living, growing her small business, and caring for her family and home is a constant struggle. To cook her family’s meals, she uses wood and kerosene for fuel, though she is starting to realize she could make a change to “smarter, better and faster” cooking methods like gas while keeping her cultural values – and flavors-- intact. \n",
      "But there are obstacles standing in her way. Can she convince her husband to support her decision? Can they afford it? How will the food taste? Will her mother-in-law approve? Can she overcome these obstacles and successfully make the “upgrade to gas”?\n",
      "Mama Imade is the fictional star of the new Alliance-supported Nollywood style web series called “The Adventures of Mama Imade”. The series was developed by McCann Global Health in collaboration with Africare, who are jointly implementing a behavior change communication (BCC) intervention in Nigeria to motivate women to switch to LPG for cooking. By watching Mama Imade’s journey from more traditional Nigerian cookstoves and fuels to a gas stove, women facing similar issues can gain inspiration and confidence to make the transition to cleaner cooking.\n",
      "In addition to the web series, the \"Upgrade to Gas\" campaign features radio programming, social media, and intensive household and community level outreach. The intervention is focused in two states in Nigeria - Lagos and Abuja – and builds from extensive research with households in those regions as well as inputs from the LPG sector in Nigeria.\n",
      "McCann Global Health and Africare were awarded support via the Alliance’s Clean Cooking BCC Fund, and are part of a portfolio of grants aimed at using communication to motivate households to purchase and adopt cleaner cooking solutions. The interventions supported under the BCC Fund are externally evaluated to measure their impact on behavioral change related to clean cooking. Additional BCC-related resources, materials, and tools for anyone designing, implementing, and/or evaluating behavior change communication activities can be found on the BCC Resource Hub.\n",

Grants from donors provide the resources for much of the Alliance’s work to support the enabling environment for clean cookstoves and fuels, including ground-breaking research, clean cookstove standards, and enterprise and civil society capacity building, and this in turn makes it more attractive for investors to invest their capital for strong financial and social returns.  \n",

      "The Empowerment Plan tackles the punishing cycle of homelessness and poverty through a unique system of employment, education and empowerment. The Empowerment Plan employs single parents from local homeless shelters and trains them to become full-time seamstresses. Their current team manufacture coats that transform into sleeping bags, which are then distributed across the nation to homeless individuals who are living on the streets.  In addition to employment, the organization offers educational and professional workshops in an effort to equip each team member with the confidence and skills necessary to lead a more sustainable, financially stable and healthy life. The Empowerment Plan believes in giving second chances to those who want it, while providing warmth to those who need it.\n",
      "Veronika’s vision for The Empowerment Plan started when she was a 20-year-old product design student at The College for Creative Studies in Detroit and was given a class assignment to design a product to fill an actual need. Upon her December 2011 graduation and after spending countless hours at local shelters, she had created an organization that began around a single idea: to design a self-heated, waterproof coat that transforms into a sleeping bag specifically for the homeless. Her idea has now transformed into a system of empowerment in which homeless women are paid to learn how to produce coats for people living on the streets, giving them an opportunity to earn money, find a place to live, and gain back their independence for themselves and their family.\n",
      "Veronika is the youngest recipient of the John F. Kennedy New Frontier Award from the JFK Library Foundation and Harvard University. She has received an IDEA Gold Award from the Industrial Design Society of America and has an honorary PhD of Humane Letters from Johnson State College. Veronika has been named one of CNN’s Ten Visionary Women in the World, the winner of the 2014 DVF People’s Voice Award, listed as one of Forbes “30 Under 30”, as well as the Chronicle of Philanthropy’s “40 Under 40”. The Empowerment Plan story has been told across the world and shared at events such as the World Summit on Innovation and Entrepreneurship and the Forbes 400 Philanthropy Summit with Oprah, Melinda Gates, and Warren Buffett.\n",
      "The Empowerment Plan employs previously homeless parents. Earning livable wages enables these employees to find permanent housing and establish a stable life for their children within the first three months of employment.\n",

      "Manmeet Kaur, the social entrepreneur who founded City Health Works four years ago, spent several years doing economic development and HIV prevention work in the developing world. She noticed that health care workers in countries like India and South Africa are particularly good at something the American system isn’t great at: helping patients take care of themselves, even in poor communities. What’s more, she noticed that those countries didn’t use doctors or nurses to do it. They used lay health care workers, some of them patients themselves, trained to go into the homes and communities of patients and help them manage their conditions.  She realized that using community health care workers would also fill a real gap in American health care, where all too often patients with chronic conditions like heart failure and diabetes are released from the hospital with little follow-up and few options when problems arise except to go to right back to the ER.\n",

Those not invited will receive an email around four weeks after submission to bring the process to a close.\n",
      "Within a month or two, interviews are arranged via email. In the interview (phone or in-person), a member of the DRK team will talk with you about you, your idea and your plan for the social enterprise. There may be a few subsequent calls with other members of the DRK team.\n",
      "Approximately 25% of those interviewed will move on to the diligence phase. This is a more in-depth process in which the entrepreneur provides resources, materials and plans. The DRK team member deeply researches your idea, the marketplace, and the skills of your team. We talk to people in your network whom you have recommended and to people in our own network familiar with the issue you are addressing. At any point in this process, if there isn’t a fit, we will let you know to honor your time and effort. About 15% will continue through to the final diligence phase.\n",
      "Toward the end of our diligence, the entrepreneur and DRK work towards very clear goals for the new venture, including metrics and milestones that help articulate the organization’s ability to achieve its mission. These metrics will be used in our work with the organization throughout the 3-year funding term. These plans are a critical foundation for the launch and expansion of the venture. In addition, we ask you to meet several other members of our team.\n",
      "DRK investments are distributed twice a year over a three-year term, totaling $300,000. A senior member of the DRK team, most frequently the team member who led the diligence process, will join the board of the organization for the 3-year term to actively support the entrepreneur to build capacity in the social venture to scale and realize their goals.\n"
